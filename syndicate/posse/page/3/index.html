Soooo, I am giving windows a try, it's been some days and I haven't used that many applicaitons.<p>I have installed firefox and given it a nice css makeover, then I installed NixOS-WSL and set that as the default terminal and ported my terminal home manager config with git, bash, starship, and other tools over to it.

Additionally, they are responsible for helping to grow the community, and to act as a liaison between their local community and KDE.<p>This is what I found when going through KDE wiki wondering how KDE as a community was structured. Seeing there were not many local groups listed, I wanted to contribute by forming a group here in Nepal. Hence, the introduction event with megarelease celebration.<p><img alt="KDE Network" src=/images/posse/kde_network.png></div></article><article class=syndicate><h2><a href=https://scientiac.space/syndications/posse-2023-12-06/>Attending GNOME.Asia 2023</a></h2><p class="subtitle --center"><code>2023-12-06</code><div class=syndicate-text><p>I'm back home from Kathmandu. This time it was an event from GNOME; the GNOME.Asia 2023. There were poeple from Fedora, GNOME, Phosh form different parts of world ; USA, Indonesia, India in Kathmandu, Nepal for a conference about FOSS. It was quite an event. Also, got to contribute to fedora by eating the 20th anniversary cake too😉, there should really be a badge for "has eaten fedora cake" in fedora badges.<p>It was a very fun and educational experience. I realize that the people in FOSS are generally very generous, friendly and helpful.</div></article><article class=syndicate><h2><a href=https://scientiac.space/syndications/posse-2023-11-02/>My First PC Game</a></h2><p class="subtitle --center"><code>2023-11-02</code><div class=syndicate-text><p>I'm not much of a gamer and haven't gamed in a very long time even on mobile which was the only thing I had before I got my laptop. Also, being a tinkerer, I spent most of my time tinkering with my Linux system and android custom ROMs.<p>Today I felt like I was missing out a lot and kinda wanted to game. Gave it a quick search and found "Hollow Knight" which seems like my type of game so I purchased it on steam. Might as well call it my first desktop game. It feels special.</div></article><article class=syndicate><h2><a href=https://scientiac.space/syndications/posse-2023-10-20/>You and What's on Your Mind</a></h2><p class="subtitle --center"><code>2023-10-21</code><div class=syndicate-text><p>I think it's normal to assume whats going one someone's mind (prejudge) and make decisions based on it. Like, If I assume something about you and do something based on that assumption and you feel like I understand you, It's a different feeling, a happy feeling. But, it's a gamble, because what if the assumption is incorrect, what if how I acted ruined the interaction?<p>So, I believe knowing a person requires a longer time then we want it to take and it will consist of mistakes and lucks that'll slowly form a decent representation of a person in our mind. For a tech nerd like me the best example for the process of getting to know a person is like training an AI model. Like, look at how DALL.E could generate images a few years back and how it generates images in the current state.<p>So, yeah! We don't know a person within a month or even an year or a lifetime because knowing is only predicting what the other mind would think and it's constantly changing and evolving. And when we think we know a person it's only a close enough representation of the actual person in our head compared to what they really are, similar to DALL.E making images out of probability and assumptions.</div></article><nav class=pagination data-style=none><a class=page-nav href=https://scientiac.space/syndicate/posse/page/2/>Prev</a><a class=page-nav href=#>3 / 5 </a><a class=page-nav href=https://scientiac.space/syndicate/posse/page/4/>Next</a></nav></div><script defer src=/assets/js/themeSelector.js></script><div class=hidden><a href=https://polymaths.social/@iac rel=me>Fediverse</a></div><div class="hidden h-card"><img class="u-photo icon" alt=scientiac src=/res/thumbnail.png><a class="p-name u-url" href=https://scientiac.space rel=me>scientiac</a><p class=p-note>A Computer Engineering student who loves FOSS and is learning about privacy, the Internet and languages writing about the things he does.</div><footer><p class=codewithlove>I can't think of things to write on a footer.
