And there I was, in the sky. Being flown uncontrollably with the wind's will.
The string of a big red balloon in my right hand and the other hand; sore, blistered and in burning pain.
I am shouting, screaming but there's no one that can hear me. All I see is the clear blue sky all around me, and a single patch of cloud far away.
I look down, the ocean, all blue, it hurts my head, I feel dizzy.
I look up, a sharp reflection of the white sun burns my eyes while the cold wind keeps drifting, jerking me left and right.
I don't know what time it is. I don't know where I am. I don't remember where I came from.
All I can feel is an excruciating pain in my arm, my eyes burning and the wind keeps piercing my body with cold.
I switch arms, and hold the string tighter. But, I am slipping, my hand's wet with sweat. I don't know If I can hold it very long.
Far away, near the horizon, I see something. Something big, approaching toward me. Or, maybe I was approaching it.
I can not describe it the way I saw it but, this is the best description I can give you.
It looked like the sky had divided the ocean into two halves. The separation looked like two bubbles of soap merging.
The ocean was same, but the water, it felt different. The colour of the sky was same, that of the water was same but, it felt wrong, weird.
I get closer and closer and closer. And then all of a sudden I had crossed it. I was at the other half of the earth.
The air was heavy, the water was muddy, the wind colder and the sky was white. It was bright but I couldn't find the sun.
The separation drifted further and further away from me. I began to sink. I could see a green patch of land from high above.
I saw two little flowers; a red, and an orange dot. I switch hands again. My neck hurts, my throat is sore. But, I keep shouting.
I am sinking down and as I sink the land got bigger. I could see the waves of grass as the wind glides through the field.
Those weren't flowers, they were two little girls sitting on the grass.
Help! Hellllllp! I scream! But they can't hear me. I keep screaming and finally the girl in the orange sees me.
She stands up, pulls the other girl's hand and points toward me. The girl in the red stands up and starts running after me.
I was a little relieved, but as the ground got closer my hand starts to give up.
I hold the string tight with both my hands with all the energy left in me. But as I the ground gets nearer, the harder it gets to hold on.
I put each and every ounce of my strength to it. It's getting difficult to sustain.
All of a sudden everything turned dark.
I can't feel my breath, I can not see, a constant beep in my ears get louder.
And a flash! The white light faded away as I saw the clouds with blue patches of sky here and there.
Half the sky covered by the green leaves of a rain tree.
I can feel a wet cloth in my forehead. Then, I hear a voice, &#34Sister! The guy is awake! Come back.&#34
I try to get up, but I cannot. The girl in the red dress comes near me.
I can see that she's wearing a red gown, it has a pattern of small yellow daisies. I look at her.
Freckles on her cheeks, black eyes, her face is glowing, skin's dark and curly black hair that's shining brown as the light passes through it.
She is beautiful. She breaks a taro leaf near a puddle, gently folds it, scoops some water in it and asks her sister to slowly lift my head.
I look at her, she is in a plain yellow dress, it has layers of white stripes in the neck and sleeves.
Grey eyes, her skin is bright, hair's brown and a small mole on her left cheek just above her dimples as she smiles and gently raises my head.
I take a sip of water, it was the best sensation I had ever felt in my whole life. I was alive, I slowly pulled myself up and leaned on the tree trunk.
I look in front of me, it was only grassland spanning up to the horizon. Then the girl in the red gown spoke to me.
&#34What is your name?&#34
I don't know.
&#34Where did you come from?&#34
I don't remember.
&#34Do you remember anything?&#34, she asked.
Trying to think I close my eyes. I clench my fists, grit my teeth and hold my breath in concentration.
