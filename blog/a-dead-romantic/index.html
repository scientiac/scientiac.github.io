the scent in the air, still draws me.
I still see those butterflies fly,
the wind still, gently whispers me.
I still sense a breath of life,
a caring hand, when one lends me.
I still hear my heart pounding,
when someone's smile, enchants me.
I still taste rose petal's sweet,
imagining her, lips kiss me.
I still feel the touch of care,
reading someone, they miss me.
  
*

When you find out, that I am dead,
with all the promises, I had made.
And all these senses, were dead with me,
leaving behind, only memories.
Memories of love, for love in return,
for those hugs, with hugs in return,
I'll be buried, with the debt of love,
only respect for you, will lie above.
With screams of love, from my coffin,
where I won't get, to see you again.
I'll be hoping, that you'll move on,
what I couldn't, they'll improve on.
Of all the pain, that came from me,
a small void, for love there'll be.
My love would want, for you to kill,
the moments of me, that you still feel.
Don't keep me alive, it traps me in pain,
when memories die, I'll die again.
And that very death, will be my last,
and I'll finally be happy, at last-alas.
For you to live, one full life with love,
I will die, and must die at'll costs.
So, here's my last, love letter so bleak.
With lots of love, your dead romantic.
