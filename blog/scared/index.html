Choosing these words, became difficult.
Minor details, I've begun to care for.
Never satisfied, wish I'd be there more.
I feel disabled, to be there for you.
Behind screens, pretending to care you.
I think about it a lot, before I say.
All possibilities and the correct way.
My thoughts, they conquer all my time.
Present, old past, new future of mine.
Right answers, I've been searching for.
What I am searching is wrong, I fear.
I say things, and think that I mean it.
They just remain words, out of my limits.
The future, possibilities of you and me.
All gathers inside, into scary feelings.
