Is it what is keeping me alive.
I just can't be afraid all my life.
It feels like I'm loosing the fight.
Why am I acting like I'm high?
It feels like I'm burning inside.
I have searched it far and wide.
Can anyone please show me light.
Are decisions getting hard to make?
This is what is keeping me awake.
Afraid that I'm never gonna make.
I keep failing the tests they take.
Am I really getting depressed?
Think I need some time to rest.
Despite of giving all my best.
I have always failed to impress.
Why am I even writing this poem?
Maybe to bury sorrow with rhyme.
Only thing that makes me whine,
That I just  have not a lot of time.
