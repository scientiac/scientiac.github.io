01: Keep Her Smiling
02: Treat Her Better
03: Make Her Laugh
04: Give Her Flowers
05: Take Her Places
06: Listen Her Voices
07: Buy Her Sweets
08: Show Her Respect
09: Protect Her Worth

It's a list of order that you cannot touch.
Some BID, Some QD but never too much.
If L status drops, PRN increase the doses.
Always test the stats with a bouquet of roses.
Treat the patient with nourishment and a gentle care.
Don't stop the treatment till the speech is fully clear.
Remember this advice, before taking part in a fight.
Never miss the endearments, no matter day or night.
Trust the procedure and follow the protocol.
Make sure to keep her VS steady and normal.
Talk a little less but keep listening to her rambles.
Don't put too much effort, just be kind and humble.
