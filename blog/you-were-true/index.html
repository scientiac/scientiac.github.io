You always said to me.
It won't always be the same.
I never wanted to agree.
It won't always be the same.
Yet all endings will be.
It won't always be the same.
Though I wanted it to be.
It won't always be the same.
When laughs have become eery.
It won't always be the same.
Everything reminds me.
It won't always be the same.
The light now casts darkness.
It won't always be the same.
Was same until we were friends.
It won't always be the same.
The roses begun to die now.
It won't always be the same.
Yet we don't know how.
It won't always be the same.
The history to be buried.
It won't always be the same.
But it only did repeat.
It won't always be the same.
Words back then and they are now.
It won't always be the same.
Love back then and it is now.
It won't always be the same.
Because the writers didn't agree.
It won't always be the same.
Like the book I have to bury.
It won't always be the same.
I pushed it hard to be.
It won't always be the same.
Like nothing has ever been.
It won't always be the same.
Like the times I used to think how.
It won't always be the same.
Because picking flowers kill them now.
It won't always be the same.
The gifts now fill me with rage.
It won't always be the same.
Since we are not in the same page.
It won't always be the same.
The &#34genys&#34 are now what I have.
It won't always be the same.
Only one in us two can be sad.
It won't always be the same.
The ink doesn't flow with care.
It won't always be the same.
The jokes made turned into dares.
It won't always be the same.
From symbiotes to paracites.
It won't always be the same.
Roses and cares to slaps and fights.
It won't always be the same.
Like spears of words that you threw.
It won't always be the same.
Were you right? Am I tired loving you?
