I had forgotten the world.
Didn't know what's real from fake.
I trusted all of you.
Never realizing that it was a mistake.
I treated you like my soul.
Not knowing the taste of heartbreak.
I gave you all of me and more.
Clearly unknown about what was at stake.
I wanted to see you happy.
But, the efforts kept making me weak.
I listened to all your stories.
Many nights I didn't sleep.
I gave you all my secrets.
Of mistakes made, that I'd rather die with.
I used to wish that you'd know me.
Before knowing that our dream was just a myth.
I let you rule my mind.
Didn't suspect a bit, of what was making me sick.
I didn't care about myself.
From you, I learned what was narcissistic.
I have finally cracked the code.
Now I know, that it was all a trick.
I had never suspected a thing.
Hallucinating to the taste of your lipstick.
