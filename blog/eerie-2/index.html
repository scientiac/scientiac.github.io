I slowly open my eyes, but, all I can see is a hole just above my head from where a bright light is entering the room.
Slowly, I turn my head and look around, there's a table, or something that resembles a table.
The colour is brown and has patches of lichens all around and on it there is a grey mug with greenish liquid.
I slowly get up from the floor and look around, the room is small and it is entirely covered by a
green moss and had radiant yellow flowers. I touch the table and it was cold and rough.
I tried to pick up the mug, it was heavy, it was carved out of stone.
As soon as I picked it up, I heard a screeching sound and a bright light appeared from an opening
that just formed on the floor. I sipped the liquid and it was just water, I drank it all.
Slipping through the opening on the floor I got outside the room. Everything was bright,
my eyes teared up, I rubbed my eyes and opened them again. As my eyes adjusted to the light, I look ahead.
Big plateaued hills of different shapes floating in air, the top of the plateau was full of what looks
like trees and plants. Around the walls of the hills were intricate paths, structured like a balcony,
hanging by what looks like strings. I see the sun, midst the floating hills with a yellow glow of warmth.
I start to walk and as I walk It feels like I am approaching the edge. I don't have to assume
to know that I am also on one of the floating plateaus. As I keep walking I am out of the shadow
cast by one of the plateau, I feel the warmth of the sun, it is comforting but It doesn't help with
the feeling that I am all alone there.
I am mesmerized with the view from the edge. Suddenly my stomach growls, it feels like I haven't eaten in days.
I see a way going down from the edge, and as I walk It just feels like I am walking on the side of a hill.
I keep going down. If it was a hill, I would expect a river on the bottom and an uphill after I crossed the river.
But, there wasn't another hill. Without a shade, the walls of the plateau were thriving with green plants, but,
there exists bits and hints of a civilization living there. I keep walking downhill and, far away I see a shed.
I make it my mission to reach the shade. I am hoping to find some food I can eat there.
I keep walking but as the shed looks closer my hunger starts getting worse, I start feeling more tired.
Sprinting faster, I try to reach the shed sooner but as am walking, something passes through my peripheral vision.
I walk back a few steps and see a creek on the wall of the plateau. I go closer to the wall and splash! I step on water.
It was leaking from the crack on the wall. And on the wall I see a small watery ball
hanging by the root of a plant. I pluck it off the root and drop it in the puddle near my leg which I would have
completely missed if I had not looked back sprinting toward the shed. It was shaped with the soil around it
to preserve a scoop-able body of water. I bent down and see a few tadpoles floating on the puddle.
I wash the ball and take a bite, it is watery and a little bitter, so I throw the remaining half it away.
I scoop some water and drink it, it is clear and cold. I wash my face, hands, and legs
, take some rest and start walking again. I get closer to the shed. There is a creature, it looks like a hybrid
of a horse and a dragon. I am astonished. It it tied to its horns and it seems to be domesticated.
Along with a pile of grass it is also feeding on the same watery balls I had tasted before.
I see a pile of grass beside the shed, it looks like it was gathered there for the creature.
I go there and see a bunch of root-balls, so I decide to eat them.
