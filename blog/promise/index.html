What could have been if promises were enforced?
A price to pay for every broken promises.
Would people still make them and take them lifelong.
Promises will be extinct, if I know the people where I'm from.
Where I'm from, people would die if they made promises.
People will cry from all the punishments.
Only the bravest could make a promise,
with no bad intentions, who's disciplined and honest.
Looking at a mirror, I have made my fair share.
Most have been broken while some are safe.
When I think about my promises, it fills me with rage.
Writing poems to calm down is just one of the ways.
For me, the cost of a promise was rage and pain.
Lost some of myself that now I cannot gain.
A promise can make a bond so strong, that's unheard of.
But, don't you dare make a promise when you know you can not love.
