Port forwarding, also known as port mapping, is a crucial networking technique that enables computers or services in private networks to establish connections over the internet or intranet with other public or private computers. It effectively transforms the port-forwarded computer into a server by linking it to the broader intranet, allowing seamless communication between internal and external networks.
When configuring port forwarding, you reserve a specific port number on the gateway exclusively for communication with a service located on a specific host within the private network. To interact with the network-internal service from outside the local network, it's essential to know this designated port number and the gateway's address.
The applications of port forwarding are diverse and vital for various purposes, including but not limited to:

Running a public HTTP server, enabling the hosting of websites accessible from the internet.
Permitting Secure Shell (SSH) access to a host, facilitating secure remote management and access to the system.
Allowing FTP access to a host, simplifying file transfers between systems.
Running a publicly available game server, enabling multiplayer gaming experiences across the web.

How to port forward?
To set up port forwarding correctly, follow these steps:

Configure a static IP address for the device you wish to forward ports to. Dynamic IP addresses may cause connectivity issues after router restarts.
Log into your router's administration panel and navigate to the port forwarding section.
Enter the specific port numbers you want to forward, along with the static IP address of the target device.
Choose the appropriate forwarding protocol (TCP, UDP, or both) based on the requirements of the service.
Save the changes to apply the port forwarding settings.

How does it work?
Port forwarding operates on the distinction between public and private IP addresses. A public IP address allows you to send and receive data from anywhere on the internet, while a private IP address restricts data exchange to your local network only.
Sending Data
When your device sends data packets, they are received by the router, which identifies the data as destined for a port-forwarded device. The router then forwards the data packet to the public IP address, making it accessible from anywhere on the internet.
Receiving Data
Conversely, when a remote device sends data to your public IP address, the router intercepts the data packet and forwards it to the specific port-forwarded device within your local network, ensuring seamless receipt of the data.
Why port forward?
Port forwarding is essential for several reasons:

Remote Access: It enables remote access to services and devices within a private network, facilitating tasks like remote management, file access, and more.
Hosting Services: Port forwarding allows hosting servers for websites, games, and other applications, making them accessible to users over the internet.
Optimizing Connectivity: By forwarding specific ports for particular services, you can improve connectivity and reduce network congestion, leading to better performance.

In summary, port forwarding is a powerful tool that enhances network capabilities, facilitates seamless communication between private and public networks, and empowers users to host various services and applications with ease.
