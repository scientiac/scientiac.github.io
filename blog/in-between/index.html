Everything, is not your wrong, but you haven't one, to forgive.
Not selfless, or selfish you'll be, but you don't, have to believe.
Some should cry, while others grin, there's no right, way to live.
Do it right, all steps by book, yet the thing, never ends in relief.
You're in pain, were ya ostracized? What did they, have to say?
Left alone, no you were not, the ghosts lie, mere thoughts away.
Don't want to blame, or see your pain, help's just, all I'll bring.
Break us part, there's no such being, death is, a one time thing.
Desires keep, pushing you through, but it's one way, up or down.
Yourself and next, you'll chastise or pride, an ego, etched crown.
Off outside the wall, the grass is green, love's final, in their eye.
All you'll want, is to reach the heaven, but are you, willing to die?
