Search engines are software that search the things you want in the vast web and shows relevant information to you. They generally search the required information using your &#34textual web queries&#34. Some are even developed to search the web using pictures you have input on it. They show the information in a list of links which are relevant to your query.
The world's first search engine was 'Archie'(1990). The most famous search engine today  is 'Google' launched in 1998.
There are many search engines, but some of the famous ones are as follows :
Google

The most famous search engine.
The best search algorithm.
Has the best image search engine.

Bing

Microsoft's search engine.
Good integration with windows operating system.
Allows preview on video search results.

DuckDuckGo

Privacy focused search engine.
Gets data from microsoft's bing search engine.
Bangs (!) lets you search directly on famous websites like wikipedia, dictionary, etc

Brave Search

Privacy focused engine (currently in beta).
Made by a private browser company 'Brave' and is resleased in June 2021
It also has the bangs (!), and is integrated with its own chromium based browser.

Search results can vary between engines due to the use of different indexes or indexing technology. Some engines fetch results from different engines and prevents them from tracking your searches. Some examples are Startpage (Google) and DuckDuckGo (Bing).
