		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I came across a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;collabfund.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;mental-liquidity&#x2F;&quot;&gt;blog&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; post about Mental Liquidity, and it got me into thinking how people do not want to change their mind, especially when it comes to generationally gapped individuals. One&#x27;s beliefs can be drastically different from the other and yet none would listen to the other and look at it from their perspective as well. Humans have evolved learning things and passing the technique that helped them survive to the new generation, so it isn&#x27;t a big deal to assume that they survived fine with those beliefs, and it is far optimal to pass on that belief than to gamble with new opinions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I hope it doesn&#x27;t just remain as a new term in my vocabulary. I believe that one should be able to change their mind on things, change my mind!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this report is to document the process of building a CV robotic arm prototype using Arduino. The arm is designed to be controlled with natural hand gestures removing the need to look at the buttons on a screen or a controller to control it. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;materials-used&quot;&gt;Materials Used:&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arduino Uno &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16 Channel Servo driver &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buck Converter &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jumper Cables &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3D Printed MK2 Chassis&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 Servos&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Portable Computer with Camera&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;software-used&quot;&gt;Software Used:&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arduino IDE V2&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python 3 &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design:&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in building the CV controlled arm is to make a schematic of it. The arm is based on the MK2 Model, which is pretty easy to 3D-print and assemble. 4 servos are used for the base, the lower arm, the upper arm and the gripper. The servos are connected to the Servo Driver and the Servo Driver is connected to 5 volts DC power. The Arduino is used to control the Servo Driver to send PWM signals to servo.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decisions for what signals to send for recognized gestures handled by a Python script which sends serial to Arduino via the USB. The Arduino receives the signal which is now converted to mechanical output.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;construction&quot;&gt;Construction:&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assembly of the base is a bit tricky with gears and servos to be attached to it, but the upper part is easily attached. The four servos are placed on the right place according to MK2 schematics and are connected to 16 Channel Servo Driver. (I connected 0,2,4 and 7 as base, lower arm, upper arm and gripper respectively on the Servo Driver.) While connecting the Servo Driver to Arduino; the VCC is connected to 5 volts and Grounds of Arduino and Servo Driver are connected. From Arduino the analogue 5 pin is connected to SCL and analogue 4 pin is connected to SDA respectively.(This connects the Servo Driver to the Arduino.) &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The servo diver is connected to 5 volts DC converted from 12 volts power supply using a buck converter. USB connected to the Arduino supplies power to Arduino as well as the Servo Driver but not the Servos connected to the Driver. The USB also doubles as a data transmission device to send serial input to the Arduino from the laptop running the python script.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;programming&quot;&gt;Programming&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;testing&quot;&gt;Testing:&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arm was completed, and it was time to test it. The servos were connected to power supply and the USB was connected to the Arduino. With the necessary code uploaded to the Arduino, the python script was run, and hand gestures were read from the computer which then converted to Serial signals and the code in Arduino interprets those Serial signals as per the uploaded code. Here, in the first trial reading the Front and Back side of the hand gave same results, I replaced the code for Left and Right aligned hand, which showed Right when I showed my right-hand palm to the Camera, and left when I showed my right-hand back to the camera, and vice-versa for the left hand. Which fixed the issue.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges-and-solutions&quot;&gt;Challenges and Solutions:&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were not many challenges to make a working prototype which my arm is at the moment. But further improvement on the gestures are going to be challenging like; to read and interpret natural human arm movements in digital form and to match the movement of robot arm with an actual human arm.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion:&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the CV robotic arm is a working prototype for better control of devices requiring less time to adapt. It helps people to be familiar with using complex devices like robotic arm in a very short period of time. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Polyphasic Sleep: Analysis</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-different-take-on-sleeping-habit&quot;&gt;A different take on sleeping habit.&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyphasic sleep is the practice of sleeping during multiple periods over the course of 24 hours, in contrast to monophasic sleep, which is one period of sleep within 24 hours. There are different kinds of sleeping habits where the most followed schedule specially in my country and also in the whole world is the monophasic sleep. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We usually sleep at night and work in the day in big chunks. Humans evolved as a diurnal (active during the day) species; we don’t see especially well during the night, and the hunting method that helped early humans catch large prey, which saw groups track them to exhaustion, works best if you can see where you’re going. It is safe to say that it&#x27;s an evolutionary advantage, or is it? &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got interested in polyphasic sleep after the video from &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;OuizzRCALCU&quot;&gt;No Boilerplate&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Though I haven&#x27;t yet started to implement it. I have been researching about it extensively. I am a student with classes from 10:00 to 17:00 every day excluding Saturday as the weekend. So, my sleeping habits should be managed according to that schedule. And attending club events and working there after the college time, I have to cram in some sleep into the busy schedule.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why&quot;&gt;Why ?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer Engineering has been an experience till now. This first year I failed miserably, the two semesters went by so fast, I wasn&#x27;t able to do much except tinker around with this site and procrastinate by writing poems when I had time. 6 subjects in the first semester and 5 in the second, these were basic subjects but now in the third semester things are not going to be easy as it was before. 7 core subjects in 5 months is not very easy to handle. Especially being the class representative who has to manage class schedules, inform the whole class about notices, maintain the teacher-class relation, be available for almost anything regarding the class anytime and unfortunately should be okay with getting calls from unknown numbers any time of the day, which sometimes gets very frustrating. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough of the rant, I need to manage time, and it should not be like how I did in the first year, It was a mess. I need my working time to be the maximum amount and that means the sleep time should be the minimum healthy amount without it making me sick and unproductive. And I see polyphasic sleep as one of the ways to tackle that problem.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what&quot;&gt;What ?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyphasic sleeping generally tends rely on the observation that our brain only gets about 2 hours of REM in every night of sleep. Hence, the main goal is to fall asleep to the REM phase and not waste time in deep sleep which is the rest of the time spent on sleep. Deep sleep is considered restful for the body but no more than waking forms of rest. Hence, the difficult part is to get to the REM sleep instantly. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many schedules for polyphasic sleep; biphasic, everyman, dual core, tri core, core only, nap only, flexible and non-reducing. Which have their own benefit and time constrains. Most of these are either very difficult to follow or do not work with my schedule and the schedules like Uberman and Dymaxion are very very difficult to follow but not impossible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientist, artist, engineer, and inventor Leonardo da Vinci, who lived from 1452 to 1519, reportedly used an Uberman schedule to sleep for 20 minutes every four hours. Other engineers and inventors may have applied this unconventional sleep pattern, such as Nikola Tesla, who lived from 1856 to 1943. Though this sleeping schedule never quite took hold among the general public, polyphasic sleep rose in prominence in the 1940s as inventor Buckminster Fuller touted his Dymaxion method, which was four equidistant 30m naps taken every 6 hours, totaling only 2h of sleep a day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;which&quot;&gt;Which ?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to my routine I am leaning toward the Everyman Schedules. Particularly the alternate variant of the Everyman Two Schedule &lt;em&gt;somewhat equidistant&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; which is one of the rarest Everyman Two scheduling options. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.polyphasic.net&#x2F;everyman-2&#x2F;&quot;&gt;polyphasic.net&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, The ideas behind this scheduling option are:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the core as a blanket duration to stay awake until very late morning hours (close to noon&#x2F;lunch break).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once adapted, the night will feel much shorter as there is more time awake until almost noon. The core usually starts around midnight or slightly earlier; this trait can resemble certain reduced monophasic lifestyles with a very early morning wake time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I can&#x27;t follow the exact schedule, I am thinking of modifying it in a way that fits with my daily routine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;modifications&quot;&gt;Modifications ?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unmodified &lt;em&gt;Everyman Two: Somewhat Equidistant&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; variant:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
  Core Sleep : 00:00 - 04:30 (4hours and 30 minutes)
  Nap I      : 10:30 - 10:50 (20 minutes)
  Nap II     : 17:00 - 17:20 (20 minutes)

  Total Sleep: 5 hours and 10 minutes

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My variant:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
  Core Sleep :  00:00 - 04:30 (4hours and 30 minutes)
  Nap I      :  08:30 - 08:50 (20 minutes)
  Midday Nap :    ~ 14:00 ~   (20 minutes)
  Nap II     :  18:00 - 18:20 (20 minutes)

  Total Sleep: 5 hours and 30 minutes

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;so&quot;&gt;So ?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adaptation is the most difficult thing to start anything. There are recommendations to jump start adaptation like; &lt;em&gt;staying awake before starting&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;naptation&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;cold turkey&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. This is just me analyzing the possibilities. I&#x27;ll write another article about it if I fail or succeed in the adaptation. Until then, goodnight! &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Anyways, the consistency with GTK apps was what I liked about it and the essence of that still remains in hyprland with EWW which is configured in yuck, hence the title.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EWW works as almost all the things, but some standalone apps are still better to have, so I have used swaync as the notification daemon and rofi-wayland as the launcher. Overall the system is pretty usable now, and I just love hyprland&#x27;s animations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! This is one of those hot takes on &amp;quot;Love&amp;quot; ooOooh!!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human nature is weird. Like, how someone would behave when they feel like they&#x27;re loved and how the behavior would change when they feel like they are indifferent to them. It&#x27;s quite fascinating that the behavioral and psychological pattern change, how cute turns into offensive and feelings turn into conscious infatuation. Apparently hope plays quite a big role in it. One could argue that &amp;quot;love&amp;quot; is nothing but just hopefulness. And when one gets hopeless, everybody knows how that goes. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is neither a paper nor a thesis, it&#x27;s just my take on love today. So, I suppose it&#x27;s better incomplete and a hot take than a &amp;quot;WHAT I SAY IS ALWAYS TRUE&amp;quot; of a vibe. Bye!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this report is to document the process of building a fire extinguishing and gas sensing car using Arduino. The car is designed to detect fire using a flame IR sensor and go towards it to extinguish it if necessary. It also detects gas leaks and alerts the user via SMS. This report will detail the steps taken to design and build the car, as well as the challenges encountered and the solutions implemented.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;materials-used&quot;&gt;Materials Used:&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arduino Uno &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 Flame IR Sensors&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MQ-2 Gas Sensor&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motor Driver&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 DC Motor&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Servo Motor&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water Pump&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire Extinguisher (tested with water)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SIM800L GSM Module&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breadboard and Jumper Wires&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power Supply (Battery)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design:&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in building the fire extinguishing and gas sensing car was to design a schematic. The car is powered by an Arduino Uno microcontroller, which controls the sensors, motors, and other components. The 3 flame IR sensors are used to detect fire from three different directions, and the MQ-2 gas sensor is used to detect gas leaks. The motor driver is used to control the DC and servo motors, which drive the car and the water pump, respectively. The fire extinguisher reservoir is mounted on top of the car and the pump pushes the extinguisher from the pipe which is spread by the back-and-forth motion of the servo motor. The SIM800L GSM module is used to send SMS alerts to the user in case of a gas leak.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;construction&quot;&gt;Construction:&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the schematic was finalized, the next step was to build the car. The components were connected to the Arduino Uno using a breadboard and jumper wires. The flame IR sensors were mounted on the front of the car on in the front and two facing either sides, and the MQ-2 gas sensor was mounted on top. The DC motors were connected to the motor driver and were used to drive the car. The servo motor was connected to the L298N motor driver and was connected to the fire extinguisher. The water pump was connected to the Arduino Uno and was used to pump water from the reservoir to the fire extinguisher which moved in a to and fro motion to spread the water coming out of it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;testing&quot;&gt;Testing:&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the car was built, it was time to test it. The car was placed in a test environment and was subjected to various scenarios. The flame IR sensor was able to detect fire and direct the car towards it. The MQ-2 gas sensor was able to detect gas leaks and activate the SMS alert system. The fire extinguisher was successfully activated by the servo motor, and the water pump was able to pump water to the fire extinguisher.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges-and-solutions&quot;&gt;Challenges and Solutions:&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the major challenges encountered during the construction of the car was the calibration of the flame IR sensor. The sensor needed to be calibrated to detect the flame accurately and direct the car towards it. The heater connected to our room was also detected as a fire source which made it harder to test the bot. This was solved by testing the sensor with different fire sources and adjusting the code accordingly. Our test subject for demonstration was a burning paper which was used for the calibration of flame sensor.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another challenge was the activation of the fire extinguisher. The servo motor had to be calibrated to activate the extinguisher at the right time, and the water pump had to pump the water at the right pressure. This was solved by adjusting the code and the components until the system worked correctly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion:&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the fire extinguishing and gas sensing car using Arduino is a useful device that can prevent fires and detect gas leaks. The car is powered by an Arduino Uno microcontroller and uses sensors, motors, and other components to perform its functions. The car was designed and built with the help of a schematic, and was tested successfully. The challenges encountered during the construction were solved by adjusting the code and the components. The car can be further improved by adding more sensors and refining the code as the SMS functionality was still flaky. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<id>https://scientiac.space/blog/life-love-twilight-and-a-butterfly/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve seen life in terms of science. Always tend to prefer science&#x27;s explanation better than any reasoning one might give to life. Because it makes sense. The relief of knowing the end. Believing in what might happen in the last moments. My preferred answers to all the things is scientific, that gives me the relief that it&#x27;ll be true most of the time. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet science fails sometimes. The tried, and tested methods might not be applicable, something that happens regularly doesn&#x27;t make it true. Consciously and subconsciously, I am still speaking of what science has proven. It has proven itself to be wrong most of the time. That, something should not be thought as one universal truth, but rather a possible truth for the current instance of time. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking outside the window, hearing the barking dogs, the sky is cloudy and it&#x27;s mildly raining. The streetlights are glowing everywhere, though it&#x27;s a moonless night, the world is still bright with life. The world around me is sleeping, it&#x27;s silent, I can hear each raindrop individually, the insects chirping, the wind and my heartbeat. A mosquito is flying around me, with its own goals, to get food, to get energy, to continue itself and preserve its kind. I have a different goal, to kill the mosquito and sleep well. Life&#x27;s keeping us both alive and awake in this night when everyone is sleeping and consciously dead. Everything is keeping me awake. Myself, the mosquito, the weather, the light outside my house, my phone and many unknown unknowns. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve read self-help books, I&#x27;ve watched a lot of talks about achievements and ideas and life, and I get inspired by it. But it doesn&#x27;t last long. Newton&#x27;s first law of motion said, &amp;quot;An object at rest tends to remain at rest, and a moving object tends to remain in motion in a straight line with constant speed.&amp;quot; Similarly, I tend to remain in the same state of what I am despite being motivated for some time. This whole analogy is faulty because scientifically an object in motion tends to remain in motion in a straight path, unless an external force acts on it. So, technically the reads and talks should have been impacting the whole trajectory of my life, and I surely can say that It hasn&#x27;t impacted enough to make a difference. The self-help books truly were written for self-help, their own self, like I am writing this piece right now for myself. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you&#x27;ll never know the correct answer. It&#x27;s fine to not know something, it&#x27;s fine to not know anything but, the realization that you will never know something is devastating. It&#x27;s the feeling of realization that you will never be able to get the thing you wished for. Life changes stories, one changes dreams, like science changes its truth over time. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some sleepless nights can get you what you want, others just take life away a tad faster. This one is the latter, the one that has no meaning, there&#x27;s no achievement, it&#x27;s just an unhealthy sleepless night. I need to sleep, I feel like sleeping, sleeping until a new day arrives, a whole new life waiting for me to sleep, so it can get to me even faster. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have explained life in different ways, how love fills it with joy, how having a friend makes it a lot easier to live, how some achievement may make you want to live a bit more. But I particularly like the way nature has taught us. If you cut the cocoon of a butterfly to let it come out of it easily, giving it love and all the care you could give, it will die, not being able to flap its wings, unable to take a flight, unable to live a life, unable to figure out things, unable to find a way to contribute to the world, unable to find a way to live longer and never getting the chance to bring more life like its own to the world. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loving an unborn butterfly is cruel, and loving a flying butterfly is stupid. One can only admire its beauty seeing it roam around the flowers, living dodging and ducking the predators and finding its own world to live, a life it wanted, not a life you wanted it to have, not a life you thought would be better, not a life with you and your unintentionally cruel love. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

and this life I was never born to,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
that the bang had never happened,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and I could see the true present.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish for God&#x27;s free will to play,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and I lost half my life each day,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
that I knew the unknown unknowns,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
could borrow the time, like a loan.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish I could move the immovable,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
want to be in the top of the world,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
wish I could travel back in time,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and for I could undo my crimes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could make everyone agree,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and could control what I see,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
control minds, mine and then others,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
visualize what all universe covers,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn a lesson with no failure,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
to every problem, there was a cure,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
wishes came true, when I want to,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
the night, bright and the day was blue.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish I knew each name and face,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
no knowledge left for me to chase,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
wish to move mountains with ease,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and make the impossibles a breeze.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To swim, in the depths of the sun,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and rewrite the laws that have begun,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
wish to be both here and there,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
to travel beyond without a care.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To know everything without learning,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and forget nothing without burning,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
but as I wish for things so grand,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I feel the weight of time and sand.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ll grasp at straws and hold onto hope,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
that someday, somehow, I&#x27;ll learn to cope,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
for wishes alone just cannot bring,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
the power to do impossible things.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Blended into same colors not existing anymore.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
What happened to doing things differently?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small possibility, it was enough.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Unique, new unknowns and histories explored.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Learning new things to learning it wrong.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Being morphed into what the past lamented.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
What became of not turning into them?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
What became of never letting oneself go?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lessons were learned, time was spent.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Tested were things and sure they were fun.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
From growing up to wishing of glowing up.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Becoming the mirror one never wanted to see.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
What happened to being the better one?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
What happened to no further breaking hearts?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lies were told, as they got out of sight.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Promises were broken as time passed by.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;

A mistake for the first time, crime if is done twice.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;

Say love for the first time, a lie if it&#x27;s said twice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Choosing these words, became difficult.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minor details, I&#x27;ve begun to care for.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Never satisfied, wish I&#x27;d be there more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel disabled, to be there for you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Behind screens, pretending to care you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think about it a lot, before I say.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
All possibilities and the correct way.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thoughts, they conquer all my time.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Present, old past, new future of mine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right answers, I&#x27;ve been searching for.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
What I am searching is wrong, I fear.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say things, and think that I mean it.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
They just remain words, out of my limits.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future, possibilities of you and me.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
All gathers inside, into scary feelings.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My hands are frozen, and my heart shivers.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
My eyes are in pain, my brain just jitters.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;ve been scared, and I cannot feel a thing.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Am I awake? Cause this feels like a dream.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Those ordinary days, I just used to chill.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Endless possibilities, I&#x27;ve begun to feel.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
If this than that, the world revolves to it.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
One inevitable rule, that I tried to cheat.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The world&#x27;s broken, my head&#x27;s full of flaws.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
As I tried things, broken were those laws.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A step at a time, I&#x27;m losing all my grasp.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I trust people, keep falling for those traps.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A thousand times I think, to decide a blink.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Where else do I seek, just to find the link.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Should take on the hits, if you are in lead.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Let others leave, while you fight to bleed.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Why should I believe, anything you say.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Cause it&#x27;s every day, people come and play.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
But all hope isn&#x27;t lost, though it&#x27;s not the same.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It remains in the fire, as the heat to your flame.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Grow up with pain; cold, droughts and in rain.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
All the things you&#x27;ve seen, won&#x27;t just go in vain.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Some good it remains, in people that I know.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Daisies as they are, everywhere they&#x27;ll grow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only light is that of the moon,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
only light that I trust won&#x27;t go.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Only thoughts are that of yours,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
only thoughts that can not go.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Gone would be my sight all night,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
if the moon, was gone, forever.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gone would be my hope for life,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
if those thoughts, could disappear.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m awake all night when you&#x27;re there,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
because, you&#x27;re awake, night matters.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;m always there, the one for you,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
because, for me, it&#x27;s you that matters.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;d rather sleep waiting for you to call,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and dream about, our beautiful world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m your&#x27;s for eternity and a little more,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and I&#x27;ll be with you, forever entangled.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s almost one and the night&#x27;s darker,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and yet my eyes, are full of your smile.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Stormy sky and the lights are off now,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and yet my words, won&#x27;t stop for a while.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The more I write the less I know that,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
it&#x27;s not enough, I should write better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s never enough for me to write you,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;m writing you one and I&#x27;ll send it later.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Cry, not loud, damp out, just weep.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poems, I write, with thoughts, so sad.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Life, I like, it&#x27;s not, that bad.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;

Wish, came true, fly high, to clouds.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Leave, when you, my heart, it pounds.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Lean, on me, each other, we&#x27;ve found.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait! don&#x27;t leave, stay here, some more.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Talk, we will, till we, feel bore.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Shies, the stars, our smiles, before.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Seeing, you happy, I adore, amor.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things, you talk, sometimes, wordplay.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Trends, I learn&#x27;t, makes sense, now they.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Voice, my style, it&#x27;s modern, I&#x27;ll say.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;

flipping through your pictures, I sleep.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;ve been dreaming a lot about you lately,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
those dreams are more yours, than mine.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I hear your voice from the texts you send,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and I smile at you, from my phone.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;ve become us and the feeling&#x27;s stuck now,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
carved in our heart, that&#x27;s made of stone.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Us talking while we walk holding hands,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
it comes before me, I smile some more.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I trust you with all my deepest secrets,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
while we share stories, all night long.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The way you complete my midway stutters,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
with your words with mine, we talk.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You hear all my weirdest of interests,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and reply me, singing lyrics of songs.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Small chats and chit-talks that we do,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
binds me tighter, up with you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Stars shine and the moon glows bright,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
we call us names, and we talk all night.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;m up all night writing poems for you,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
with my heart, saying the words I feel.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
We are now entangled with a stranger force,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
it&#x27;s something, we don&#x27;t understand yet.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
When it started we had nothing to lose,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
but now to lose, it&#x27;s too late.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Poem, no, it&#x27;s just a disguised story.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
One of the many ones.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A story, with no end, or a beginning.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It&#x27;s of a different kind.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Stress, my only cause of disappointment.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And It&#x27;s a long line.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Love, I thought, could handle it well.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Foolish! I was wrong.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Reason, It&#x27;s not you or the system over us.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It was me all along.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Scared, I thought that I can&#x27;t ever be.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Cause you always were behind.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Empty, I always am, I need some more time.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
With no one but you as mine.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Story, I am trying to write about love.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Sadness is what occurred.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Fear, if not? What might be love, then?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Of breaking someone&#x27;s heart.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s time, I need to change.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;ll tell you the things I see till range.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see you as vacuum in a jar.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Of space that I love.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Much care and love to it.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You don&#x27;t get to sob.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surrounded by the forces.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Atmosphere, enemy of yours.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It&#x27;s me, yes! I am the jar.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I won&#x27;t break, pushes I endure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s no cure, once a hole.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Nothing will be the same, I&#x27;m sure.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Delicate and vulnerable, oh you!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A story for my emptiness, you&#x27;re pure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The voices in my head, they talk but are afraid,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I see the things in red, am I the only slayed,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
all my things they&#x27;re swayed, feelings say I&#x27;m dead,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;m lying on my bed, plans for dodging baits,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
the waves as sharp as blades, poisonous than lead,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
always there too late, laughters that were paid,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
the legends always said, people, they get played,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I hope that you stayed, it&#x27;s already been too late,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I keep making mistakes, not sure of other ways,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
my own mind has been jailed, everything I have failed,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
with everything left unsaid, slowly, these feelings fade,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
now as I lie awake, scared and scarred with no escape,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I think of how much it takes, to empty a heart so full of rage,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
voices, so very deranged, talking about the things that remain just as unexplained,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
freefalling into darkness, with hopes way too high up to mess,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
little by little the sadness trails, gets me ruthlessly betrayed,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
see the loudest smiles being staged, oh, I&#x27;d rather silently dread,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
the stories get just more mysterious by the day, with too much to hear and very less to ever say,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
maybe it&#x27;s all just a fake, this feeling I cannot quite shake,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
worse as the thoughts remained, misery almost always accompanied,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
maybe the voices in me are better dead, for my conscience to be by my side instead.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It symbolizes how two brains may say things in different ways but mean the same.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Did you think, the wait was over?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Oh! it&#x27;s has just began.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Your thoughts and dreams, and what not,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
it&#x27;s killing you from the &#x27;in&#x27;.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The more you wait, more will you think,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
it&#x27;s seems normal to me.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The more you think, less becomes you,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
as it&#x27;s supposed to be.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are a puppet, with some feelings,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
no brain that can see.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Just be a slave, approval you crave,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
it&#x27;s not your property.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Failure you are, more you seek,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
appeal from somebody.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Weakness all yours, it&#x27;s just one thing,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
irreplaceable monopoly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#x27;re just a dog, that needs a treat,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
you swing your tail around.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Give it a stop, once bark and bite,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
show, it is your surround.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You need to be, the one in charge,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
don&#x27;t shoot your foot here.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Describe your plans, redeem your spot,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and make them all clear.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you believe, the bad in you,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
sure it is coming through.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Resist the thought, and build it up,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
save it for what is true.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
All the times, the sleepless nights,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
they should remember you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Get your team, make good friends,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
you be the joining glue.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A circle needs, the center point,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
just until it is formed.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Then it gets lost, the void so deep,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
not coming back unharmed.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You should be best, compared to you,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
it&#x27;s only truth I know.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Resist the world, it&#x27;s filled with greed,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
you&#x27;ll reap what you sow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind your back, it&#x27;s just knives,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
not one is helping hand.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You look both ways, back, up and down,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
you&#x27;ll never know what will land.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Sometime you fall, just get up,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
you&#x27;ll need to sprint fast.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Before you speak, make a plan,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
or you will cry at last.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things will come, they go as well,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
even truths change with time.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Life gives you lemons, make lemonade&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
sell it and make your dime.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Keep trying things, make, hack and create,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
to try, it&#x27;s never too late.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
When you will shine, and build your fate,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
it&#x27;ll be worth the wait.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;synopsis&quot;&gt;Synopsis&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A room, a pen and a keyboard.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Poems, they&#x27;re just assumptions.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Today, I&#x27;m out from my comfort.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And I observed my surrounds.....&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a woman, talking with her dog.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It too jumped, and went for a hug.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Saw a man, a very huge load.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Dust, rough clothes, in a graveled road.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A girl riding her scooter, gliding through air.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Didn&#x27;t have a helmet, wind flowing her hair.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
In many people, common was a single thing.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Smiling they were, happy they seemed.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
My assumptions were wrong, I was blind.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Happiness was, just, a state of mind.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Though It may, It&#x27;s transferred from things.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Dog to the woman, way to the man.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And the scooter, that was her charm.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Something seemed off, a false positive.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
My data gave results, somewhat relative.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It&#x27;s what I saw, I here am the proof.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I saw a grandma, praying on her roof.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Seeing her face, there was a smile.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Why was she happy? I thought for a while.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
My data has shown, and it&#x27;s not wrong.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Hope was the key, the proof was strong.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It comes to me, times I used to hope.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Happy I was, no reason to sob.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Me, my questions, all starting from &amp;quot;how?&amp;quot;.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The realizations, they are, all I have now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Poems, the way I speak.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Eyes, they talk but weak.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Gestures, that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll give.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;ve always been like this, so, believe.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words, I just write them.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Fourth, like I always came.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Resist, all my feelings, then.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
All those thoughts, in my brain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Times, it has been many.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Rhymes, if I found any.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Chimes, my heartbeat makes.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Just three words, that&#x27;s all it takes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine, like I always am.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Smile, I was programmed.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Clear, it&#x27;s like a diagram.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Life tests us, it&#x27;s an exam.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shine, it&#x27;s my turn to.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Crime, would be to not do.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Perfect, though I seem blue.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I have to hide, with no clue.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heart, it&#x27;s always been soft.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Sweet, like I have always loved.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Fighting, though, I&#x27;ve been idled.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Like life, this poem, everything&#x27;s untitled.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What have I done for you?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Do I expect some things?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;ve always been there, your shadow.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Pushing limits, the poem sings.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do I feel not included?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Do you see me as a stranger?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;ve been there with you all the time.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Yet I&#x27;m alone, it&#x27;s all stranger danger.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing you, I think it&#x27;s love.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Things I&#x27;d do to make you smile.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And yet you&#x27;ve lost me here.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I see you found your style.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expectations, they are gone now.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I think, I am done here.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Ignoring you would be so great.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You don&#x27;t know what love is, dear.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve lost people this way.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
One person at a time.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Now I feel how my mom felt.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;ve been too kind, I&#x27;m fine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blind spots, though, you see things.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I was always in your side.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Some sides you don&#x27;t notice.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Though, you notice far and wide.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t care what you saw.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I always did my part there.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You should have seen me do it.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
My spectra were loud and clear.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I think why I did it.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Should not have pushed the bounds.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Now, every time it scares me.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Your eyes, the face, those sounds.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think I&#x27;ll stop what I did.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
But others deserve the same.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
So, I&#x27;ll behave the same way.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Until I finish crossing their name.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t feel missed by you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Because feelings can be false.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
But the proof doesn&#x27;t lie me.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You missed me, middle of the alls.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Many times, I wonder, emotions.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Make my life, heaven, hey Hell!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hope to win, their heart, their fake gods.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;ve been Lost in time, no space, my free soul.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Things I&#x27;ve done, till now, the good deeds.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Wishes my soul, in Dise, oh Hell please!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burning in the flames of fire, one, I feel.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The ice cold blistering curse, two, the itch.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Torture and pain to purify, three, my heart.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Being eaten alive, no mercy, a new birth!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think I&#x27;m going one hell, many choices.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
One where Christians go, is it, the Hell.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Or be it in the Hindus, they say, Narak.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
May be it&#x27;s them, Islam,  Jahannam!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choice and chances, I see it, the truth.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Feels like I&#x27;m in it, sometimes, my ruth.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m going, to one, I bet.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
All hail to it, null heart, true hell!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sins all those, I&#x27;ve done, to them.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Brings my soul, near you, to pure.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Chop me into, pieces, ream me.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Then you&#x27;ll see, the good, in me!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kills and flesh, the blood, torn wide.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Things I think, the ways, dark side.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Greed and jealousy, the thoughts, kill me.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Dear Hell, I only trust you, clean me!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>How I use the Internet Today</title>
		<published>2022-12-02T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2022-12-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

		<id>https://scientiac.space/blog/how-i-use-the-internet-today/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today&#x27;s internet is a nightmare to use and navigate, in my opinion. I have little knowledge about the old internet. So, I don&#x27;t have much to say about it, but from what I have experienced in the old internet is that it was actually decentralized. Firstly,  our internet is occupied by the tech giants. When I talk about the internet, a normal person would think that it&#x27;s something that makes Facebook work or something that helps us to chat with people in WhatsApp. The concept of internet being a social, decentralized hub where people can express themselves in their own way has been shadowed by the famous monopoly, i.e. meta(in my opinion, but there&#x27;s google as well), and now it is seen as the place where we play by the rules of a company and express ourselves in short microblogs with limited number of words and a single UI where everyone is forced to be in the same place because they will be alone if they want to try something new. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other things are search engines and advertisements. The search engines today show us results which are paid for by the owner to show on the top of the search result or optimized in such a way that the search engines will show us the particular sites on the top. Either way, it provides people to choose specific words and hijack the search results of a person, shadowing the factual results. Many websites that I see on the top are websites written by bots and hosted just for the sake of people clicking it and watching their ad, i.e. to earn money without any real information.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about ads, the ads too are harmful nowadays. The ads today are mostly targeted and changes according to the user&#x27;s web usage and interests. Targeted ads may be a good way to earn money from but are equally bad because it can be about anything, a news website might have ads for a gambling app or a good writer may have an ad which supports something illegal. They are not chosen and trusted by the owner of the website which puts their reputation in danger as well as the person surfing a good website may get scammed because they trusted the ad from the site they trust.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;now-let-s-get-to-the-topic&quot;&gt;Now let&#x27;s get to the Topic&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;browser&quot;&gt;Browser&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I need even before I access the internet is a browser. I prefer the Firefox browser because it helps the world by saving us from the monopoly that is chromium&#x2F;chrome. The thing is that,  every device today comes pre-installed with chrome and even if you go and get a browser from the internet it is most likely to be a chromium based browser (Opera, Vivaldi, Microsoft Edge, Brave, UC Browser etc.) if it isn&#x27;t Firefox. If Firefox was not a thing, the web would have been controlled by a sole company, i.e. google, whose main aim is to give as much ad to the people so that they can earn money. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;new&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;search-engine&quot;&gt;Search Engine&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I have Firefox installed, I prefer to choose a search engine which doesn&#x27;t show targeted ads and works most of the time. I choose DuckDuckGo for that, but you may have your own preference. DuckDuckGo or DDG for short claims that it&#x27;s a privacy focused search engine, but they seem to have better results than google for not being a sell-out. It&#x27;s not perfect, and I do get websites written by bots or scams there as well, but is a &amp;quot;good guy&amp;quot; than google.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;duckduckgo.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;content-blocker&quot;&gt;Content Blocker&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have Firefox with DuckDuckGo, I need a content blocker. My choice in it is uBlock Origin every single time. It&#x27;s a must-have add-on to surf the web without being covered by pop-ups and ads. It removes most of the ads as well their spaces in the websites, so you don&#x27;t get blank spaces in the middle of an article or post. Furthermore, it also has advanced features like the ability to remove specific elements from a website, which comes in handy when it cannot remove stuff completely or if I want to remove something from a website that&#x27;s bothering me to read something there.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ublockorigin.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;uBlock Origin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing all this is mostly enough for a normal internet user because it solves most of the things that the modern internet forces upon us.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tiny-little-details&quot;&gt;Tiny Little Details&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;containerization&quot;&gt;Containerization&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use an add-on made by Firefox called Firefox Multi-Account Containers which allows me to keep all the parts of my online life contained in different tabs colour coded and labelled, helping me to keep different activities or sites separate from each other. What it does is that it allows me to do shopping stuff in one container and research stuff in another without the cross site cookies being shared with each other, making my shopping life not interfere to my academic life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;multi-account-containers&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Firefox Multi-Account Containers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;yum-cookies&quot;&gt;Yum! Cookies&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cookies are small files sent to your browser from websites you visit. These files monitor the sites you visit and the items you click on these pages. These are used to remember what you did in a particular site the last time you visited it. I mostly reject cookies and allow only the essential ones. And to automate the process I use an add-on called &amp;quot;I don&#x27;t care about cookies&amp;quot; which blocks the pop-ups and if the cookies are essential it accepts it and I never have to do the annoying thing every time you open a new website.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.i-dont-care-about-cookies.eu&#x2F;&quot;&gt;I don&#x27;t care about cookies&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;password-manager&quot;&gt;Password Manager&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an abundance in social platforms and having to use multiple things being a heavy internet user, I need to have multiple accounts with multiple passwords and authentication process. So, to manage my password I use Bitwarden, which helps me save a lot of time as well because I log out from everything every time I close my browser. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitwarden.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Bitwarden&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;enhancers&quot;&gt;Enhancers&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use sites like YouTube, mastodon and hacker news and I don&#x27;t like the experiences there, it may have to do with design or any other things like bringing back the dislike counter on YouTube. I use add-ons like stylus, sponsor-block, return YouTube dislike, YouTube enhancer etc. to improve my experience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;returnyoutubedislike.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Return YouTube Dislike&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;add0n.com&#x2F;stylus.html&quot;&gt;Stylus&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;navigation&quot;&gt;Navigation&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a vim guy and having vim keys bidden to the browser is just that cherry on top that I needed. For that, I use an add-on called &amp;quot;Vimium&amp;quot; which does exactly that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimium.github.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Vimium&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has their own use-cases and people use the internet for multiple things. Following my method and using my configuration may not be viable for everyone, but it works for the most part. The best way to improve your experience is to use the internet and experiment with it to set it up to your liking.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and also on privacy respecting media.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are my views on this topic so, a reply with a correction or your view would be highly appreciated.
For a different perspective on this topic, check the end of this article.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-experience&quot;&gt;My Experience&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encountered what privacy is by coming to Linux and interacting with the people of the FOSS community. And It has taught me things that I would not have learned anywhere else. But when it comes to why we need privacy, and why losing some comfort is worth it, I quite can&#x27;t teach or make it clear to people. I follow the practice to be private on the internet mostly because I agree with the people from the community. I learned about the Gemini protocol, the Fediverse, the Matrix protocol, self-hosting and many more concepts because of the community.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not using Facebook and mainstream social media like Instagram, Twitter, etc has surely changed the way I think about people and the internet but it also has broken my contact with my family and relatives. I asked the ones who wanted to contact me to install &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; and to contact me there since it was the easiest to set up and use for everyone. Though it isn&#x27;t a perfect replacement for a &amp;quot;social media&amp;quot; like Facebook it has done the job for the most part, at least has fulfilled my basic social interactions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;here-are-my-thoughts-on-the-positives-and-as-well-as-the-negatives-of-maintaining-trying-to-maintain-privacy&quot;&gt;Here are my thoughts on the positives and as well as the negatives of maintaining&#x2F;trying to maintain privacy:&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-positives&quot;&gt;The Positives&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;judgements&quot;&gt;Judgements&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an undeniable fact that we judge a person firstly by how they look. If they look clean, wear attractive clothes, has big eyes we seem to make our mind up that they are the kind of friends we want and if anyone has a darker skin color, is wearing oversized clothes, or has imperfections on their face we tend to be far from them. Being and interacting with &amp;quot;anonymous&amp;quot; people on the internet has made me think about our prejudice toward people. Nobody has judged me and I haven&#x27;t judged anyone but have helped each other regardless of how we look (here on the platforms like mastodon(Fosstodon), Gemini(Station and Geminiverse)). So, one aspect of privacy on the internet that I like is that it minimizes prejudice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;safety&quot;&gt;Safety&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining privacy and not disclosing the location of where we live, who our relatives are, where we work and many similar &amp;quot;Oh! it doesn&#x27;t matter.&amp;quot; things will make us safe from the people who &amp;quot;hate&amp;quot; us or our views and may bring threat to us. It creates a virtual chamber where we can settle disputes without physical contact and gives everyone enough time to think and argue about their view.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;tunneled-vision&quot;&gt;Tunneled Vision&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet has lost its position from the place where we gain information about a vast range of topics to the place which agrees with what you like and nothing else. These algorithms in our media collect information about us and feed us what we have an interest in, which may seem to be a very good thing when we look straight into it but behind it, it&#x27;s not something made for our comfort but for them to increase our watch time in those media and show us as many ads as possible which also are shown based on our interests making us their product to the ad distributors. So, being private and not letting these media collect media helps us to not get distracted by ads and not get tunneled to a certain view as it won&#x27;t just show what we prefer but also shows us multiple perspectives.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;focus&quot;&gt;Focus&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not having to care about maintaining an image in the media and being seen as equal by everyone else and treated like everyone else removes many burdens from the mind and helps focus on the subject matter and views instead of branching focus to other unnecessary variables helps (at least for me) to be more productive.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;expectations-and-mental-health&quot;&gt;Expectations and Mental Health&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being private on the internet also demands similar people and media thus taking away the people that may create a sense of insecurity, like having expectations of being a celebrity or being &amp;quot;socially accepted beautiful&amp;quot;, getting celebrity worship syndrome, expectation for filmy love or romance. Since everything on the internet is not true and mostly tampered with to make it look &amp;quot;good&amp;quot;, being private on the internet and using media that respects ones privacy helps a lot in preventing psychological health issues, especially for teens.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;more&quot;&gt;More:&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decrease in chances of scams and spam,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protection from identity theft,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offers freedom to express oneself, and much more that I cannot think of.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-negatives&quot;&gt;The Negatives&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;fame-and-recognition&quot;&gt;Fame and Recognition&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need fame and recognition to be respected in human society and being famous on the internet has become our priority but internet privacy and fame might not go together so, complete privacy isn&#x27;t possible. A well thought privacy threat model should be implemented never-the-less to mitigate the threats instead of completely giving up on internet privacy because having fame adds more threats as well as responsibilities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;connection-and-contacts&quot;&gt;Connection and Contacts&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losing contact with relatives, friends and family trying to give priority to privacy is one of the most experienced downsides of it. Not everybody understands or cares about privacy and leaving centralized privacy disrespecting monopoly leads to losing contact with people you were in contact with yesterday. Using workarounds to access those media may mitigate the issue but is not a complete solution.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;information-distribution&quot;&gt;Information Distribution&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to get local news and information distributed by collage and clubs or the organizations where we work, which mostly are circulated exclusively on the centralized privacy disrespecting monopoly media. This centralized locking of information has been one of the barriers to freedom and internet privacy as well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;more-1&quot;&gt;More:&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being an outcast from a circle,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A hassle to manage and keep track of,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People try more to exploit you the more you try to be private, and unfortunately, the negatives too don&#x27;t end here.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privacy in itself is a very broad subject to be discussed. A single person&#x27;s view isn&#x27;t sufficient on what privacy is and what isn&#x27;t so I expect some flaws in my writing if seen from a different perspective. So, I thought of accumulating everyone&#x27;s view on it. I also request you include a list of authors and their articles related to mine at the bottom of your reply&#x2F;article as I have done below. That way everyone who is reading can find every other person&#x27;s view.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please send your article to me at @scientiac@fosstodon.org if you wrote a reply so that I can include it on the list below.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Who He Was</title>
		<published>2022-10-31T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2022-10-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://scientiac.space/blog/who-he-was/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://scientiac.space/blog/who-he-was/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;He had lived a life of a villagen; who was neither a villager nor a citizen. He was seen as a citizen by his village friends and a villager by his city friends. To his view he was a citizen as he lived in a town for studying and went to his village if there was a holiday of any sort.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because of that he knew the customs of the both worlds. The tradition and behaviours of village as well as the city had moulded him and his behaviours, as he wanted to be treated as native by both of his friend groups.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;village&quot;&gt;Village:&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a kid he would take goats for grazing, climb trees, run down the hill to the river, played with mud and sticks, football made up of clothes stuffed inside a sock, fly kites, slide in coconut leaves, made wheels by cutting slippers soles and run assuming they were cars or bikes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his teens he would still go to the village where his grandparents lived farming, ploughing and growing stuff. But he would not get a chance to experience how all those things were done. He&#x27;d sit as an outsider and watch them plough the field, controlling and turning bulls at their command and made them drag the plough on the filed. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They worried about him and his nice, clean clothes and would ask him to stay far from the field and not get dirty. He wore his dad&#x27;s old clothes and went to the field sometimes, but they still wouldn&#x27;t give him a chance to work, saying he&#x27;d get hurt.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;city&quot;&gt;City:&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While he was in the city, he&#x27;d play snake on his dad&#x27;s Nokia and watch cartoons like Ben 10, Pokémon, Bakugan, Dragon Ball Z, Tom and Jerry, Moo min, Zig and Sharko, etc on TV.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His dad got a smarter but still keypad phone (Nokia X1) which had internet, and he made his first Facebook account in it. He would download Java games like Assassin&#x27;s Creed, Spider-Man, Ben 10, Mario, Diamond Rush etc from Waptrick. When bored he would dig through the deepest settings of the phone and change things, which might have planted his love for computers at that time, and he still does it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#x27;d often go to his friend&#x27;s house and watch them play with their PSPs and Computers. He was always fascinated by how those things worked.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here his friends would not let him play with their PSPs and Computers as he didn&#x27;t know how to use them, and they were afraid if he would break it. As smartphones were at the market, his uncle gifted his mom with a Samsung Smartphone, and he played offline games like Temple Run, Mario, Plant vs Zombies, etc in it. The mobile data costs were high at that time and that has an effect on him till today; he doesn&#x27;t play online games.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;influence&quot;&gt;Influence&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He knew things of both village and town and even the teachers who taught them about primitive technologies and  other old things would be shocked by seeing him recognize everything they read from the book since he had seen them being used. He taught his friends to communicate secretly by the special language he learnt at the village (basically it was putting a special syllable before every syllable and speaking it that way. The special syllable was &amp;quot;cha&amp;quot; and the word &#x27;development&#x27; would be &amp;quot;cha-dev cha-lop cha-ment&amp;quot; but in our native language of course.)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#x27;d teach his village friends to make a Facebook account, upload posts, download games on their phones and all that &amp;quot;techy stuff&amp;quot; they thought was magic. He shared downloaded movies and music to them. He was a tech guy to everyone there. He still gets calls from his relatives if any kind of mobile related problems occur to them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is surely due to limited resources, He would use everything by pushing it to the limits. Still today, he digs through the settings of a newer looking phone, hoping he&#x27;d find new interesting stuff. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was never a native and that made him unique which he still enjoys being.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;today&quot;&gt;Today&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today he went to his village for a visit, and was devastated by the collapsing old house as it is abandoned and nobody cares for it. He got one day to recall all memories he spent as a child and also a teen. One day of sitting on the floor eating with hands in a smokey warm kitchen with food grown in the kitchen garden or rather &amp;quot;kitchen field&amp;quot; with no added chemicals. One day of eating fruits by picking it himself from the tree. One day of gazing at the stars shining brightly above the heaven below. One day of wishing to meet his old friends who mostly are now abroad for money. All those memories to come back melting the heart and eyes of who he was, me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s a lot of things going on in my mind, right now.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Too many things I want to bring them out, but how?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Pain, mistakes, regrets, just aches that I have, oh wow!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Things I wish that I had stopped doing by now, no doubt.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every nice thing I try to do goes wrong, you know?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Break yourself along with the people you love, oh no!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I tend to win them back with some more truth, although!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
They wont ever know the darker side of me, just hope.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love others like the way you love yourself? please don&#x27;t!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Gave my whole heart away but she did&#x27;t want it. I wont.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Show them that you love them equal by heart? You can&#x27;t.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Know that you don&#x27;t have anyone to talk now, then rant.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tears from my eyes sliding down to the pillow, it&#x27;s wet.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I wish that I had pushed myself a bit harder, too late.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
One will stop loving me the way they do now, I&#x27;m afraid.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Not happy of what I keep on doing everyday, you bet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do it better than that I thought of? No way!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Say you have all the answers to my problems? Go away!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I don&#x27;t care what you think about my things, oh nay!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
So you went away and did it all your way? &amp;quot;hooh-rayh&amp;quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think about the past and think what&#x27;s new, do you?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Ghosts from the past haunting me everyday, aaah...phew!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I kept on cheating my way out from them, noone knew.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Keep looping back and repeat all my mistakes, not new.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need some people who say what I write are bad, I do.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I try to pour down everything on my writings, lies too.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Both my cheeks go red and the brain goes dark, heart blue.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It hurts to write and it hurts while writing, it&#x27;s true.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-poem-written-by-two-different-brains-with-different-emotions&quot;&gt;A poem written by two different brains with different emotions.&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incharge, I thought I was,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
thought I could control them.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Soo bad, was I soo wrong,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
couldn&#x27;t see when they came.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swiftly, they came by and got stuck,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
thought they&#x27;ll pass by and not stay.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Warm and subtle, they lured their way,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I fear I might be the one standing at bay.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shocked, I was to then know,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
how those began to then grow.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Scared, that&#x27;s all I was now,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
hide them? or, shall I show.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dilemma, you ask? that might not just justify,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
for I could decide but still not be bold.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Sunshines and storms, it slowly spoke sense.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Let it go or have faith and hold?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worried, I tend to cry sometimes,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
though my heart, warm it feels.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Defeated, from all these norms,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I bow to them and then I kneel.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longing, because it always feels home,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
but sometimes I wish I had a shield.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Quarrels and conquers, looking for win.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Somewhere, I know, I have to yield.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Those few moments before disasters,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Moments of breakups and pain,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Moments of failures and pain,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Moments of stress and pain,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Moments of rejections and pain,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Ahh pain!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
My one true friend, my love.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The one who never leaves me.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The one and the only!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I love the constant breaks and patches.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I love how you surprise me.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I love the things you do to me.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Yeah! Pain! I love you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I don&#x27;t remember the day I met you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
My first cry, probably was you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Pain, you make me happy.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The relief that it already happened.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The hope of mending the mistakes.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The feeling of being happy again.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Ohh pain!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
My one true friend, my love.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The one who loves me back.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It&#x27;s you who makes me strong.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It&#x27;s you who help me make decisions,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
strong, bold and difficult decisions.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Keeps me awake, help me breathe.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Without you, I may not exist.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
What&#x27;s &#x27;happiness&#x27; before you?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Like, that one girl, whom you like but....&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
That sweet cake, delicious but...&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
That engineering tag, with knowledge but....&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Those nice abs, with wows but...&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Happiness, you&#x27;re just full of buts,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&amp;quot;but toxic&amp;quot;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I just love the pureness of you, pain.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The night before a new day,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
or the day before that starry night.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It&#x27;s you who helps me though things.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
it&#x27;s you who showed me the world,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
to think differently, to live!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Oh pain!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
My one true friend, my love.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Facebook a Choice, Not an Obligation</title>
		<published>2022-07-03T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2022-07-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-brief-reminder-of-the-freedom-of-choice-and-privacy&quot;&gt;A brief reminder of the freedom of choice and privacy.&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, I decided to ditch Facebook and meta in overall because of the raising privacy concerns and addictive nature of these mainstream social media platforms. Of course backed by my knowledge of privacy and the help of different online communities, especially the Linux community talking about internet privacy and the openness of FOSS I quickly realized that the world of internet is not a very good place to be in, especially the social media platforms without federation and very high filtration of what people can&#x2F;not, want&#x2F;not to see. I realized that the posts that I am scrolling through are picked and compiled for my tastes and to keep me stuck in the place for so long that I see enough ads and decide to buy one of the products that I see is what I want but don&#x27;t need.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt that the social media should not have any filtration over its contents by a person to person basis but have a good moderation for a set of people&#x2F;community where one thing of one community may think what they are doing is good&#x2F;legal while the other communities because of their social norms sees bad&#x2F;illegal. Another thing is the arrangement of posts, the posts should be arranged in a chronological manner with respect to time (new posts on the top and older at the bottom.). It should be private and should have an ability to federate with other platforms if one decides to not use it but wants to be in touch with the people inside it. And last but not the least It should be open by which everyone is ensured that they are safe and the company&#x2F;organization is not using our data for their own betterment behind our back.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what you get is not always what you want. I had to make a Facebook account because my university circulates all its regular notice via Facebook and only Facebook, despite them having a website of their own where they do post some very specific notices. I could have lived with the university&#x27;s specific notices but every other group&#x2F;club&#x2F;association; the club for students interested in robotics, in software development, associations of computer, civil, etc  engineering students, etc inside my university share information solely on Facebook which I being someone interested in robotics as well as software really want to know.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be a whole different story if anyone except I were concerned about their privacy and&#x2F;or didn&#x27;t use Facebook with one reason or another. But even if I proposed a solution it will be just for me, and they will eventually stop following it and keep posting on Facebook as they are doing right now.  I quote Olamundo from mastodon (@olamundo@red.niboe.info), &amp;quot;Having a Facebook account is an option (which highly educated people are expected not to take, considering current news and concerns), not an obligation.&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s very difficult to maintain privacy on the internet, either you have to completely disconnect from them or keep using what they give without even considering if privacy was a thing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposable Solutions :&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a website for everything with support for RSS.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using mastodon or any other federated social media for notice circulation, along with some sort of redirection to it for Facebook.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using MATRIX w&#x2F;o bridges for those who don&#x27;t want an account on discord&#x2F;messenger and still be able to contact with everyone.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using discourse or similar software for notice as well as chats.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anything that doesn&#x27;t require any specific non privacy respecting software and is accessible by everyone.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Everybody has experienced rejection.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Some are brutal, some meh! It&#x27;s fine.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I have experienced both, and yeah brutal.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
One is a personal rejection and the other...&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The other is weird, a chain rejection.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
But a chain rejection is weird and brutal.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A chain rejection occurs only in a group.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#x27;re presenting something in a group.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
An event occurs, which was&#x2F;n&#x27;t planned.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
One person supports the event and other,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and other and other and finally everyone.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
That moment, your presentation in crushed&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Crushed into pieces, pulverized, and finally&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
burnt to ashes, remains the dust, the dust,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
that&#x27;s of no use, a dust of pain and anger,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
In my case the it was dust of my first try,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
the dust of my confidence and finally,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
the dust of my creation, my happyness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weird right ?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, naming a phenomena is fun,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
sitting in silence swinging is fun too,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
writing a poem in pain and anger,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
too much fun!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The poem stores your anger in it,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And finally the poem heals you,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Ohhh! I had fun at last.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
What a great day!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Experiencing chain rejection, was fun.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I am welcomed, It was fun, Thank You!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Multiple consequences, resulted from different decisions,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
to here, I started writing a poem.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Some say the flow is linear,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
but I like to assume it&#x27;s not.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I like to compare it to how Huygens described light.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;

Would  there be another instance of this universe?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;

It makes us sad,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A short time with her.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It makes us beg,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;

		<title>Using Light Mode</title>
		<published>2022-04-30T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2022-04-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://scientiac.space/blog/light-mode/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://scientiac.space/blog/light-mode/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been a fan of dark mode for a long time. People including myself are so invested into dark mode that everything whether it supports or not is on the dark scheme, or even worse &amp;quot;pure black&amp;quot;. Every website turns black no matter what the creator had intended. Every app goes dark forcefully with mismatched buttons and forms but we still use it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have read many articles about people changing their display modes to &#x27;light&#x27; and saying that &amp;quot;dark-mode&amp;quot; isn&#x27;t as beneficial as we considered it to be. We all assumed that dark mode reduced the strain in our eyes and also saved battery. I cannot be a 100 percent sure and say that it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend reading the article published by The Nielson Norman Group¹ about dark vs light mode, where they have concluded that using Light mode resulted in better performance than using the dark mode for most people.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We humans evolved collecting food&#x2F;hunting in the daytime and taking rest at night, our eyes are developed to be used in the presence of more light. Eyes in general are supposed to be more functional and useful when more light is present. The pupils in our eyes becomes wide when we are in an environment where there is less light, and they  become narrow where there is more, but the performance of our reading doesn&#x27;t just depend upon the amount of light passing through our pupil, but also the size of the pupil through which the light passes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our eyes just like the cameras work in the same principle (Actually cameras work in the same principle as our eyes do). If the  aperture of the eyes is larger, the depth of field is shallower as a result it is harder to focus on things, but when our eyes have enough light the pupils shrink making the aperture smaller and eventually increasing the depth of field and making it easier for us to focus.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not that &#x27;dark-mode&#x27; has no advantages. It has! The claim that it saves battery is correct, but only if the technology used in the display is OLED. But most laptops and display people use are IPS&#x2F;LCD panels, which cannot turn off the pixels to display true black like OLED does. There is always a backlit besides the screen which glows when the screen is on even when the colour displayed is black. Dark mode may even be better for people with cloudy ocular media (like cataract) because the display emits less light as the people suffering from this problem prefer less light as more light reaches the eye with a cloudy lens, there’s a bigger chance of a distortion. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light mode isn&#x27;t perfectly good either, because there may be long-term effects associated with light mode, like the chances of myopia.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their study, Andrea Aleman and her colleagues at University of Tübingen in Germany asked 7 human participants to read text presented in dark mode and light mode for an hour each. To see if their predisposition to myopia changed after reading, they measured the thickness of the choroid, a vascular membrane behind the retina. The thinning of the choroid is associated with myopia.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light mode helps us focus better and also reduces strain in our eyes as compared to dark mode, automatically improving our performance and hence our productivity. But in the long term, there might me chances of myopia. Another thing is that dark mode is still required for the people who still enjoy dark mode and also for the people who are suffering from cloudy ocular media or similar problems. 
As of me, I will be continuing the experiment and keep changing things and try different shades of colours keeping the light theme in mind. I am a person who loves the terminal, so the terminal in light mode is going to be very difficult to adapt, but let&#x27;s see where this experiment takes me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wonder what a blind man sees.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Does he see darkness like I do&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
or does he feel colors through his ears?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what a deaf woman hears.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Does she feel silence like I do&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
or does she enjoy music with her eyes?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what a dead person thinks.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Does it think of nothingness which I can&#x27;t&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
or does it think with it&#x27;s soul flying? Up! up in the sky.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m Unexperienced, I don&#x27;t know any.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Lost inside the wonders that my brain creates.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Is there a way to feel what others do? No!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s no good or bad in wondering.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The people dying in my head when they are late.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It&#x27;s just my own brain trying to scare itself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get overly excited wondering a thing.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A thing that&#x27;s close to impossible, soo close.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And then I am demolished by the same impossibility.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The positives and negatives of wonder.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
They are contained within themselves.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
All the difference is made by the truth I expect.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all the unreality breaks down in a while.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I snap back into existence, the real world.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Where the world is driven by it. Yes, wonders!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what I could be if ……………………&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Why is this thing in my mind?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Is it what is keeping me alive.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I just can&#x27;t be afraid all my life.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It feels like I&#x27;m loosing the fight.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am I acting like I&#x27;m high?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It feels like I&#x27;m burning inside.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I have searched it far and wide.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Can anyone please show me light.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are decisions getting hard to make?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
This is what is keeping me awake.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Afraid that I&#x27;m never gonna make.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I keep failing the tests they take.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I really getting depressed?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Think I need some time to rest.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Despite of giving all my best.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I have always failed to impress.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am I even writing this poem?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Maybe to bury sorrow with rhyme.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Only thing that makes me whine,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
That I just  have not a lot of time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

And others I don&#x27;t want to fix.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Those mistakes I find myself.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And others, resonate from noise.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try doing things my way.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And others are forced on me.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Those things I understand.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And others, they go in vain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking questions I learn a lot.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Other things are (m.a)ed to try.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Now I play with: Force = m.a&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And others, I just know, don&#x27;t ask!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days I just listen, no talk.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Runners teaching toddlers to walk.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And I think they should let them fall.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Other times, I know that&#x27;s love.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Showing faults, is not what they like.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It&#x27;s kinda like training wheels on a bike.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I know generally medicines are bitter.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Don&#x27;t forget some poisons are sweeter.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Need to win that wicked mood.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
But don&#x27;t need to win always.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-brief-introduction-to-strategy-of-big-tech-companies&quot;&gt;A brief introduction to strategy of big tech companies.&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything in this world requires competition and challenges  so that it could evolve. So if there is nobody to compete with, there cannot be development. This is a serious issue in today&#x27;s tech world where tech giants like Google, Facebook, Microsoft have gained total monopoly in their fields. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with google, the operating system you use which is android is Google&#x27;s product (Though the actual operating system is open source the services built on top of it are mostly made by google and are closed source.) ,the phone app you&#x27;re using is from google, the photos app , YouTube, Calendar, Email, Maps, Podcasts, Assistant etc. are Google&#x27;s products but no one searches alternative for  because they are interconnected among themselves. If you just delete your email account your photos backed up in the cloud , your youtube libraries , your location history and addresses ,your browsing history, bookmarks, your phone book, the services logged in with google, everything will be deleted so, you will not be able to (and will not even consider to)  get out of it&#x27;s system.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, lets look at Facebook (Now known as Meta). Everybody uses facebook but no one knowns that there exists platform mastodon, disapora , friendrica, etc which has the same objective as Facebook&#x27;s. But facebook being a big company knows what to do to not let people escape from their own ecosystem. They saw Instagram as a competition but instead of competing with it they decided to buy it. Now, everybody who were in instagram got connected to facebook services. Similarly , they purchased WhatsApp because it felt like a threat to their own facebook messenger. If they couldn&#x27;t buy it, they take the main feature of that particular apps and add them to their own. They brought the stories feature and the disappearing messages feature from snapchat, twitter had a heart button they brought a whole range of buttons with different emojis on it saying it&#x27;s a react button They also bought Oculus which was a company  developing virtual reality headsets. As of now, the only way to log in to the headset is by using a facebook account. You can sign-up for a different thing like pinterest (For example) via your facebook account which seems like a easy way but it&#x27;s not. Because if you somehow lose your facebook account ,now a totally different platform is out of access because it used facebook to log you in. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about Microsoft they are the king in the space of desktop computer operating system. Almost every apps are made for windows, their office suite &amp;quot;the Microsoft office suite &amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Office 365&amp;quot; has become the only office suite that is used by almost everyone even if there exist other suites like only office, libre office, etc. They have their own extensions for files .pptx , .docs, .xls etc which is used by almost every office computer in the planet where the .odf (Open Document Format) which is an open source document format doesn&#x27;t play well with their office suite so the people using MS office will keep using the same office and doesn&#x27;t leave them. The OS itself comes pre-installed on computers so no normie would ever change the OS instead they will just keep using what they got i.e. microsoft.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a tip of an iceberg and there is a lot more in this topic. This behavior of big tech companies completely destroys the competition on the market because there remains nothing to compete with when they are the only one providing that service.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;something-that-my-hyperactive-brain-came-up-with&quot;&gt;Something that my hyperactive brain came up with.&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I live in a dark place. There is no light and the cold freezes me near to death. I can barely be alive, these decisions are hard to make. Should I burn my clothes or should I keep them on. Should die feeling the warmth or is it better to live longer shivering in the cold? Is it better to hide my feelings and be happy in front of others or should I make them pity about me and get relieved thinking they know the pain? &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a human being, I can think about the consequences. I can see the effects of my choices. I can predict the outcome. I can do calculations more than any animal on the planet can do. That may be a good thing but the dilemmas, the multiple consequences, the positives and the negatives, values and cultures, my religions, my gender, peoples expectations, judgments and a lot other things like those add a lot of variables to the decision. Should I break all the cultures that has been taught to me to marry the girl I love or is it better to break up with her and marry someone who my religion and the stars lining on the sky think is best for me. This is just an example, but there are more dilemmas as we gradually move from a superstitious and highly religious society to a scientific and more literate society. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am in a society where a decision made by me can break the elders heart but can be a good example for my children on the future. I can marry a guy being a man which might be a shameful act for a society of the age group of my father but on the other hand could be a great example to the future children that being gay isn&#x27;t a thing to be ashamed of.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to make the world a better place by making everyone like ourselves. We think that our opinions are better than all others. Nobody wants to hear what someone is saying but everyone wants to say something that they think is the best. Instead of embracing the difference we have; color, religions, cultures, gender, shape, richness, etc and a different set of brains which can think differently we tend to fight against each other thinking we are not the same. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped writing this article four days ago and I am trying to give this a proper ending. But the way my Brain processed these things is different than it was four days ago. I am unable to think further. The thing that I realize from this is that not even my own brain thinks the same every time. The same article will be different If I wrote it in a single day than if I wrote it one paragraph each day. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We humans don&#x27;t want to change from who we are. We don&#x27;t want others to teach us what is right or wrong but we do want to teach others. We feel happy on finding mistake of others. Not everyone will realize this anytime soon and the world is not going to be a better place in the near future. It&#x27;s like the adoption of Linux as an operating system. There is not going to be a mass adoption of Linux anytime soon even though It is the best operating system which is privacy respecting, easy to use heck even &#x27;ecofriendly&#x27;. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everything that is good is praised and adopted by everyone. It is mainly because they don&#x27;t understand it or because they are so used to their own thing that they don&#x27;t consider that change is a good thing. Nobody can convince anyone to adopt something they like if the person have no understanding of what it is (The case is even severe than that if that person has false information about it). The thing is that, people get scared of the things they don&#x27;t understand. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is not going to change anyone&#x27;s mind if someone disagrees with what I have written but will definitely bring a smile to the faces of the ones who did agree with what I am saying even before I even wrote it. Because that&#x27;s how a human brain works.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With the big bang&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Dust was formed.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Those combined&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Stars were born.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Some big some small,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
rocks were found.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
They revolved around&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and then turned round.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With passage of time&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
galaxies were formed.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
One of the galaxies,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
is our home,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
which contains a star&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
that we call sun.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was burning&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It was big.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A ball of fire&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
revolved around it.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
As the ball&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
started to cool&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Something called water&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
began to drool.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the water&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
life was formed.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
As life grew up,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
it used the sun.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Seeing the sun&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
up came plants.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
They were everywhere&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
on water , on land.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With plants on land&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
fishes came up&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Breathing under water&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
living on sand.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Then they left water,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
land was home.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
On the forests&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
they began to roam.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They grew up&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
with the trees.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Also started flying&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
like birds and bees.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Like the trees&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
they were huge.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
With their presence&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
earth would lose.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then one day.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
the sky was bright.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Big ones slept&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
the remaining were light.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Small creatures&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
began to hide&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
under the ground&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
without any light.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earth was cold&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
everything was freezing.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It was ice age&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
when they were living.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
As the ice&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
began to melt,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
All the creatures&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
relieved they felt.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trees were back&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
the sun was warm.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The birds started flying&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and bees with swarm.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The apes came up&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and, then came men.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Men built houses&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Men made farms&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
That was how,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
we evolved.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All with time&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
we filled the earth.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
With cities and kingdoms&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Fights were fought.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
After all settled&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
we all were one,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
We made tech.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
we made phones.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Suddenly the earth&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
was small as stones.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that earth&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
They both were found.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Then they married&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
the oath was sworn.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
They were together,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
love was grown.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And that is how&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You were born.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>My Experience with Bricks and Bootloops</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-scariest-moment-when-flashing-custom-roms-for-amateurs&quot;&gt;The scariest moment when flashing custom ROMs(for amateurs).&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone told me to root a phone five years since now, I would get scared of damaging the device. I didn&#x27;t have internet at that time and also a very little knowledge of what it could do. I just knew that it could let me see the passwords of connected WIFI as well as the passwords of WPS enabled WiFi which at that time was like a treasure to me. A friend of mine had rooted his phone and he shared his experience that his phone was completely dead a few days after while adding a module. He shared stories of phones blasting and catching fire because of root and since I didn&#x27;t have internet there was nothing to do except to believe in his stories. Those stories caused me to think that I would never root my device ever.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after some years we had internet in our own house and I used to watch life hacks, hacking videos, new gadgets and inventions, new and useful apps for android, phone reviews, customizing android, and all sorts of tech videos on YouTube. On some hacking videos (hacking with an android, I didn&#x27;t have a computer at that time.) I again stumbled upon root. Then I watched videos describing benefits and disadvantages of rooting. I loved to watch what a phone could do with Magisk modules and was very eager to try rooting. But still deep inside my brain there was a feeling that I would damage my new phone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a lot of watching advantage and disadvantage videos I decided to root my phone, I knew that it would void the warranty of my phone but after four months of buying I was so eager that I unlocked the bootloader (MI made me wait 7 days) flashed a custom recovery and rooted my phone. I installed a bunch of modules with Magisk and Ed-exposed, tweaked MIUI with substratum which did cause my first boot loop, but it was easily fixed because there was a zip pre-managed by substratum for those cases.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days after I rooted, there was an update to MIUI and I decided to install it like I normally did. My phone wouldn&#x27;t boot to the system, It just rebooted after the MI logo. I was having chills in my heart, suddenly I felt very cold, I booted to recovery and tried to format my device. It didn&#x27;t solve the issue, but all the files on my device were deleted. I started searching for fixes, I flashed the official MIUI ROM by forwarding it via adb, but the Issue was still there. I tried flashing pixel experience, Havoc, Corvus etc. but nothing worked. It was 12 AM already, and I still was trying to fix my phone. Then I found out that there is a different kind of ROM that could be flashed from fast boot mode, first I tried the latest fast boot ROM, and it still didn&#x27;t work, then I tried the oldest fast boot ROM, It changed the boot screen to old MI logo but was still stuck on a boot loop. At that point I was crying, I had bricked my phone, The warranty period hadn&#x27;t finished, but my warranty was already void. I slept at around 2 AM with a cold heart and tears in my eyes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning I woke up at 5 AM, at that point I was ready to do anything to fix my phone. I tried a bunch of things from the internet but none of them worked, then I came across a tool called &amp;quot;ALL in One&amp;quot; on XDA forums dating back to 2014 (This story takes place in 2020). I immediately downloaded the tool, installed the exe file, and opened the program. There was an option to flash recovery ROMs, I downloaded the latest official recovery ROM, connected the phone to my computer and flashed it using the tool. And magically it worked, a tool from 2014 saved my phone. But that incident didn&#x27;t stop me from rooting my phone because as soon as the phone booted I went back to the recovery mode and flashed the magisk file.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some weeks I flashed a custom ROM from the same tool and fell in love with it. I tried different ROMs after that and yes I did go into a boot loop sometimes, but I could easily fix it. Now, it isn&#x27;t a big deal to me to flash a ROM or root anyone&#x27;s phone and I love doing it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication. It refers to files easily read by a computer, called XML files, that automatically update information. A link to a website is created using this tech and that very link is identified by an RSS reader software which then fetches the information from that particular linked site and shows it to the user. RSS was created by Dan Libby and Ramanathan V. Guha in 1999 with a motive of making it easier to subscribe to web feeds.
Checking each site one by one will take forever. Signing up for their newsletters could ensure you keep up with the latest updates and information, but it&#x27;s also easy to mistake the emails as spam or to ignore them altogether in your crowded inbox. Then again, relying solely on the site&#x27;s social media updates might mean you miss something important you wanted to know about.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, RSS helps you create your own e-magazine where you get only the information you want to get from the sites you&#x27;ve chosen. Not only can you subscribe to your favourite websites, but you also can subscribe to blogs and podcasts if the RSS reader supports it. RSS readers can fetch text information, audio, images and even video files, so you won&#x27;t lose any information you want to get in any form. Even though it can fetch every kind of file all you get in an RSS reader is the title, a short description, some pictures or a video, and the link to the original website (Usually* because RSS cannot fetch the ads present on the site which hampers the monetization of those sites since no ads = no income.).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;advantages&quot;&gt;Advantages&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get the latest updates. Whether it is about the weather, new music, local news, or a new posting from a rarely-updated site, learn you get as soon as it is published.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can save a lot of time by reading a self curated feed instead of browsing all the websites one by one.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike emails, you can easily subscribe and unsubscribe whenever you want.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You won&#x27;t be spammed with useless information, unlike emails where you might get every kind of spam and non-informative emails after they get your email.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The feed you get is organized in a chronological order, and you can keep track if it is already read or not.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RSS doesn&#x27;t have ads and trackers that you find on a website, which is good for your reading experience as well as your privacy.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;disadvantages&quot;&gt;Disadvantages&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Articles (Info) from the sites is received in a certain amount instead of the whole article, so you are very likely to go inside the webpage instead of just reading the RSS content.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is very difficult to accurately track the number of subscribers who read an RSS feed or the items contained in an RSS feed.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RSS readers load up different websites at once and since most RSS contents doesn&#x27;t contain full articles you also go to their website, increasing the data traffic.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RSS contents will not be counted as views to the websites, so it could impact on the income of the creator.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSS is a very old but useful tech. With it being one of the go-to methods of creating feeds, RSS has been implemented in various fields and can fetch different data from different sources. I am personally using RSS to keep track of what my friends are doing on Instagram and Twitter, as well as subscribing to websites as well as YouTube channels I like. These social media don&#x27;t have RSS integrated with them, but frontends like Bibliogram(Instagram) and Nitter(Twitter) allow you to subscribe to the publicly available profiles with RSS. RSS is a must-have thing if you go to websites frequently to get information.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Sad? Just Smile!</title>

&lt;p&gt;Many people I know are constantly sad and tensed, and I wonder why it is the case. Because I am a pretty chill guy, my sadness lasts for a very short time. It might be because I have very fewer responsibilities and don&#x27;t have to do much work. I don&#x27;t know how it actually feels like, maybe I haven&#x27;t experienced something they have experienced. I see people stressing out and wonder why they don&#x27;t be &amp;quot;just happy&amp;quot;. It sounds dumb, but that&#x27;s what I feel, why wouldn&#x27;t they just feel happy about what they are doing. I know that It&#x27;s like telling a person with depression to just be happy. But actually that is the feeling I get when I see these people. It&#x27;s totally fine to be sad, I am an adult and I do cry sometimes, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that I am sad all the time. Or even if I am feeling bad I smile, and after a while it goes away. If there&#x27;s no need to look sad (like, in a funeral or anything else.) I just like to handle the situations smiling or even giggling. That has its own benefits, but a huge negative is that it makes you a little &amp;quot;not serious&amp;quot;. I have experienced this a lot, mostly when I am giving a suggestion and my friends doesn&#x27;t give a damn about it. Is it really necessary to be bold every time and say the things you want to say in a so called &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot; manner? I usually don&#x27;t talk in groups but a single person  and I do try to make attempts to make the other laugh in a conversation, but that&#x27;s everyone I guess, because who would really like to be very serious in a conversation. There&#x27;s a huge role of a person&#x27;s expressions in a conversation. If the speaker is smiling and talking, the listener will definitely smile despite the pain inside them, the person will feel fresh after taking with you even if they were sad. If you&#x27;re feeling angry, and you talk with someone in an angry manner, you will get the same expression from them because that&#x27;s how it works. A simple smile can determine the day of that person you were just talking to. Now that I think of it, it feels more simple. It&#x27;s like Newton&#x27;s third law of &#x27;motion&#x27;, but with an &amp;quot;e&amp;quot; on the front. If you smile they will smile back, if you are angry they get angry back at you, if you help they will help you back, if you are sad they will feel the same (though it&#x27;s not the same thing that you&#x27;re experiencing, but they do). &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s funny how people don&#x27;t realize that they both are angry and arguing with each other because one person was a little angry which started a chain reaction on their anger now they both are fighting. I am not funny nor am I very handsome and charming, but a smile is all it takes to make a person next to you feel happy, and I do smile.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;that-s-all-for-today-keep-smiling&quot;&gt;That&#x27;s all for today, keep smiling.&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;

Flying inside those galaxies,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
though far from my sight, I see it.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Like nebulae in the heaven, your eyes.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
There are times I am attracted to you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Pulled by the warmth inside you,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
though distant, I feel you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Like Chandra feels around Prithvi.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And...&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
There are times I fly free.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
In my own worlds, inside me,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
singing, dancing.... but,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I sense you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Like a hole in my own oblivion.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time can do a lot of things.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Walk you, build you, heal you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Break you, rape you, kill you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And yet you never died.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
From inside me, you resist.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
There are times without you,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
times when I feel free.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The greatest times of all time.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Those &amp;quot;sometimes&amp;quot; I enjoy.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
With people I do want to like.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Until you come ,&amp;quot;the big crunch!&amp;quot;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;

		<title>My Journey to Linux and Privacy</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;butterfly-effect-of-my-encounter-with-kde&quot;&gt;Butterfly effect of my encounter with KDE.&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first came across linux a couple years ago [In 2017] when I was surfing the internet about customizing the windows desktop, and I saw a video about customizing the KDE Desktop. I clicked on that video and realized that the thing he was using wasn&#x27;t windows but something else. I quickly searched about KDE and I found Linux. At that time I didn&#x27;t have my own personal computer that I could modify, not even windows. I was just curious if it was possible to customize computers as I used to customize my smartphone a lot.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux isn&#x27;t something that you understand with a random video especially if the video contains words like &#x27;distro&#x27;, &#x27;desktop environment&#x27;,etc. So, I started searching about those things. And as I learnt new things about linux new terms and words kept comming up and I searched about them and got some information about them as well. No sooner I started researching about linux, I realized that it was very vast. I realized almost everything on a linux system can be replaced by an alternative program.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came to know that the linux operating system is an Open Source operating system. I searched about open source too and got a simple idea that if the source code of a software is visible and changable by any people from anywhere than it is an open source software. (I didn&#x27;t even know what a &amp;quot;source code&amp;quot; was and did some research about it too.)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed linux youtube channals like Chris Titus Tech, The Linux Experiment, etc (Not DT because I didnt like his presentation even though he is my favourite youtuber as of now.) and began to watch their videos regularly. I really liked the concept of open source too, so I gradually started switching my phone apps to open source  apps like &#x27;MX Player&#x27; to &#x27;VLC&#x27;, &#x27;Chrome&#x27; to &#x27;Brave&#x27;, &#x27;Google to Duckduckgo&#x27;, etc. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I researched about Linux and OpenSource for more than two years, then the Corona Virus struck, countries started lockdowns and everyone was trapped inside their houses. First year went without any classes not even online but when the second phase hit every school and colleges starting pushing online classes. And since both of my parents were teachers and a tiny smartphone didn&#x27;t handle the online classes very well, we had to buy a computer. Then, in the beginning of 2021 we bought a laptop (This is the first ever full-fledged computer that I ever had in my own house.). &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just the day after we bought the computer I was so curious that I wanted to install linux on my computer, I didnt find any pendrive on my house except an old 2GB pendrive that my father had, I backed up the pendrive to the windows and started searching for linux images. All the distros I wanted to try were more than 2 GB in size and then I decided to install arch linux. I read the documentation and watched some videos and sucessfully dual booted (Virtualization was a no-go because this computer had a HDD and 4GB of ram) my computer with Arch Linux and Windows.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started learning new things, especially the terminal and tested out different Desktop Environments and Window Managers(I couldn&#x27;t use it). I starting using FOSS and one of the main perks of FOSS was &amp;quot;Privacy&amp;quot;. Till then I used to make an account for each and every site I found, that too with my real name and primary email address. I learnt more about privacy and how we cannot trust the propraitory services and softwares. I used to use evernote, I migrated to Joplin. I started hating big tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Facebook etc. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started hating the algorithms that showed the feeds of my facebook, Instagram and Youtube. I started hating them for the fact that they collect a lot of information about us and our devices. I hated the fact that the required unnecessary permissions even to use their apps. I hated the fact that the messages were not end to end encrypted. I hated the fact that the posts weren&#x27;t on a chronological order based on the time of the post published. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started searching for alternatives but the thing about social media is that I couldn&#x27;t just find one and start using it because all my friends were on facebook and Instagram and not anywhere else. I couldnt convince the majority to make an account on an unknown platform where there&#x27;s noone other than me. I made accounts on mastodon and matrix and started using them. I invited some of my friends to these platforms, some are still here and some already deleted their accounts.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently deleted my facebook and snapchat account and  I will soon be deleting my Instagram account too. Matrix didn&#x27;t seem to be easy to understand for the normal people so I am beginning to invite them to signal to be in touch with them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-a-few-days-i-will-be&quot;&gt;In a few days I will be :&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deleting my Instagram Account.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installing a custom rom without google in it.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making list and rss feeds of the people I follow on twitter and youtube.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using as much open source as possible.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backing up my data from google to nextcloud.
...and maybe more&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

		<title>Terminal and CLI</title>
		<published>2021-10-01T00:00:00+00:00</published>

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-s-like-alcohol-bitter-in-the-beginning-obsessive-later&quot;&gt;It&#x27;s like alcohol, bitter in the beginning, obsessive later.&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A terminal in reality is a hardware component that is used to enter and transcribe data to the computer but the terminal we are talking about is an emulator of the hardware; a terminal emulator.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We linux users without the use of terminal suffer to do basic stuff. Searching for a command from a huge list of buttons is a hassle, if you know what the command is you can immediately execute the particular command in a split second. Since, the GUI is built around the terminal interface rather than making a GUI application and then implimenting the termnal functionality, it is much easier as well as faster to execute simple commmands in the terminal to get the work done. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;advantages-of-using-a-cli&quot;&gt;Advantages of using a CLI&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CLI applications takes less space than a full fledged GUI application.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being lighter it is snappy to work on.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is clean and minimal.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great applications like awk, grep, wget etc. are available which are designed to do one thing and do it well.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because it is so flexible. Commands can be piped together (ls | grep filename), they can be captured (gcc program.c &amp;gt; .&#x2F;standard_out 2&amp;gt; .&#x2F;standard_error), and can be substituted (ls &#x2F;home&#x2F;&lt;code&gt;whoami&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; or ls &#x2F;home&#x2F;$(whoami))&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detailed information about what a program is doing can be seen in TUI interface which is generally disabled in GUI for the sake of making the it look beautiful.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of the ability to automate tasks. cron and bash scripts allow long, complicated, and&#x2F;or repetitive tasks to either be simplified or automated completely.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is universal and is same across all kinds of *nix operating system despite of the use of different DEs , Themes or Layouts. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get to know and handle the tools better.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;disadvantages-of-using-a-cli&quot;&gt;Disadvantages of using a CLI&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remembering all the differrent commands is hectic.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multimedia applications are useless.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of inappropriate command some would say.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad for certain tasks that involves graphical UI.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things that require a lot of typing, such as long file names, can be annoying without minimal cut&#x2F;paste support.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People when they feel the need of using a CLI get scared of the *nix operating systems (Windows do have a command line interface but not as powerful as the *nix terminal.), this is a reason why people are afraid to try linux and is it&#x27;s greatest dis-advantage.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search engines are software that search the things you want in the vast web and shows relevant information to you. They generally search the required information using your &amp;quot;textual web queries&amp;quot;. Some are even developed to search the web using pictures you have input on it. They show the information in a list of links which are relevant to your query. 
The world&#x27;s first search engine was &#x27;Archie&#x27;(1990). The most famous search engine today  is &#x27;Google&#x27; launched in 1998.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linux Distribution or Distro is an operating system based on a Linux Kernel which is configured in a certain manner. A typical Linux distribution comprises a Linux kernel, GNU tools and libraries, additional software, documentation, a window system (Xorg or Wayland), a window manager, and a desktop environment. They also vary upon what device they are made for ;desktops, servers, laptops, netbooks, mobile phones ,tablets or a toaster. There  are thousands of distros out there which have different and unique user experience. They are classified by packaging systems, installation method, user experience, software availablity, release cycle, philosophy, use cases, etc. So, a complete chart of classification is difficult to make.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-of-the-famous-linux-distros-are&quot;&gt;Some of the famous Linux distros are :&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;arch&quot;&gt;Arch&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arch Linux is an independently developed, x86-64 general-purpose GNU&#x2F;Linux distribution that strives to provide the latest stable versions of most software by following a rolling-release model. The default installation is a minimal base system, configured by the user to only add what is purposely required.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File Mask - .pacman&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Package Manager - pacman &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;debian&quot;&gt;Debian&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debian is a free operating system (OS) for your computer. Debian uses the Linux Kernel, and most of the basic OS tools come from the GNU project. Debian generally follows standerd relese cycles and is easy to install and run.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File Mask - .deb&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Package Manager - apt &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

Red Hat Enterprise Linux is released in server versions for x86-64, Power ISA, ARM64, and IBM Z and a desktop version for x86-64. It too generally follows standerd relese cycles instead of rolling relese.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File Mask - .rpm&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Package Manager - yum&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;slackware&quot;&gt;Slackware&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the oldest currently existing linux distribution. Slackware provides no graphical installation procedure and no automatic dependency resolution of software packages. It uses plain text files and only a small set of shell scripts for configuration and administration. It too is a standerd relese distribution.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File Mask - .xz&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KDE Connect is a KDE application that connects your phone to your computer if you have a Linux Desktop (Windows integration is on beta). It is very Powerful, I can say that it is the best among all the Phone - Computer integration softwares across all the operating systems. The Features of KDE connect are as follows : &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sharing-files&quot;&gt;Sharing Files&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can send files to or from the computer very easily. It can either be done by opening the app and choosing the &#x27;Send Files&#x27; option or just by opening the share menu from the file and choosing the recieving device.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;multimedia-control&quot;&gt;Multimedia Control&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can pause, play, rewind, foreward, turn volume up or down from each device connected via KDE Connect. You can control the media on your phone from your computer or you can control the media on your computer from your phone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;presentation-remote&quot;&gt;Presentation Remote&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can turn your phone to a presentation remote if you need it. It can use the accelerometer and gyroscope sensor to detect the motion and point on the area on your screen just by moving your phone in the air. You also can change slides from the app itself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;remote-input&quot;&gt;Remote Input&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use KDE Connect as a trackpad and a keyboard for your computer of you need.  This functionality can be set both ways, you can also use your computer to type things on your phone. It also can bring mouse like functionality where it creates a mouse pointer on your phone which can be used via the computer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;browse-your-phone-s-storage&quot;&gt;Browse Your Phone&#x27;s Storage&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KDE Connect uses sshfs to connect your phone&#x27;s storage to your computer wirelessly. You can edit, move, copy, rename, etc the files of your phone via your computer in it&#x27;s file manager. You can basically do anything you can do with the file manager.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;find-your-device&quot;&gt;Find Your Device&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use your computer to ring your phone or use your phone to ring your computer if can&#x27;t find one.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sync-notifications&quot;&gt;Sync Notifications&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can receive the Notifications of your phone on your computer as well as can receive the Notifications of your computer on your phone. You also can reply from the other device if it support replying from heads up notification.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can sync the clipboards of your devices so that you can copy something on one device and paste the same thing on the other device.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;terminal-commands&quot;&gt;Terminal Commands&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the most powerful feature of KDE Connect and which I love the most. You can set pre configured buttons on your phone with a particular line of command which will be executed on your computer with a single click from your phone. Some of the things you can do are :&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shutdown&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restart&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hibernate&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Lock and Unlock Desktop&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open applications&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take screenshots&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibilities are endless, you can do anything you can do on a terminal. This feature alone makes KDE connect far superior than any other software.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonus-tip&quot;&gt;Bonus Tip :&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can easily get the screenshot of your desktop on your phone with a single click of a button on your phone with this command preconfigured on the KDE connect settings.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly,
Install flameshot and timer
Make a hidden screenshot folder.
Then, set the following command on the &amp;quot;run command&amp;quot; section of KDE connect settings.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;flameshot screen -p &amp;lt;Your New Screenshot Folder&#x27;s Path&amp;gt; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; timer 5 s ~&#x2F;audio&#x2F;duck_song.mp3 hide &amp;amp;&amp;amp; mv &amp;lt;Your New Screenshot Folder&#x27;s Path&#x2F;*&amp;gt; &lt;Path of your device  folder which is mounted via sshfs&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;linux-you-want-it-you-get-it&quot;&gt;Linux : You want it, you get it.&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A desktop environment is a set of programs running on the top of an operating system which share a common graphical user interface. It is also known as graphical shell. It determines the user experience, look and feel, customisability, usability and many others aspects of a graphical experience. It is abbreviated as DE. A desktop environment can determine the whole user experience of a operating system.
Every operating system has a desktop environment but Linux is the one with multiple swappable desktop environment. Since Linux is very modular  you can swap almost anything from it which also includes the DE. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows and OS X doesn&#x27;t give you the ability to change DEs so there is  not much to talk about them. But we have a lot of DEs in Linux, some of the popular ones are :&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;kde&quot;&gt;KDE&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KDE is one of the most famous and customizable DEs. It also is my favourite DE. KDE is considered as the most customizable DE of all. You can customize   most of the parts of your DE from the system settings and additionally you can add modules and third party applications to customize KDE even more. It is very lightweight and easy to use out of the box. It itself is &amp;quot;the beauty and the beast&amp;quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;gnome&quot;&gt;Gnome&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gnome is also one of the most used and popular desktop environments. It is very very beautiful out of the box. It is fairly customizable and easy to use.   Gnome is very good for normal people because you don&#x27;t really need to customize it to get a smooth and beautiful desktop experience. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;xfce&quot;&gt;XFCE&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XFCE is termed as a light  desktop environment with very low ram consumption and a fairly customizable desktop environment. It is the most suitable DE for old computers with weak hardwares. Basically, it is  fast and low on system resources, while still being visually appealing and user friendly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-list-of-des-will-go-on-and-on-but-some-other-de-are-as-follows&quot;&gt;The list of DEs will go on and on but some other DE are as follows :&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MATE&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LXQt&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deepin&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cinnamon&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pantheon&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cosmic&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unity&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cutefish&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moksha&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LXDE, etc&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;normally-des-offer&quot;&gt;Normally DEs Offer :&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A set of standard APIs, a programming environment, and guidelines.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set of languages to choose from.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Settings to configure whatever you want.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A suite of essential applications including a camera app, a file manager, a terminal emulator, an image viewer, music and video player, office suite, etc.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A display manager which determines the look and feel of the  login screen.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-standard-markup-language-for-documents-in-the-web&quot;&gt;A standard markup language for documents in the web.&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is a language that makes the documents of the website readable to human which we normally see while browsing the web. It was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. We don’t know the exact date of HTML creation, since it was a long term project, but the birthdate of the first HTML website is known to be on August 6, 1991.  The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called &amp;quot;HTML Tags&amp;quot;, first mentioned on the Internet by non other than Tim Berners-Lee. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every webpage may actually be a HTML file. Each HTML file is just a plain-text file, but with a .html file extension instead of .txt, and is made up of many HTML tags as well as the content for a web page.
A website may often contain many html files that link to each other. HTML files can be edited with any kind of text editor since it is just a text file.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTML tags are the hidden keywords within a web page that define how your web browser must format and display the content.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly tags have two parts, an opening and a closing part. For example, &lt;html&gt; is the opening tag and &lt;&#x2F;html&gt; is the closing tag. The closing tag contains the same text as the opening tag, but has an additional forward-slash ( &#x2F; ) character in front of the word.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;css-styling-html&quot;&gt;CSS - Styling HTML&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets It is the preferred way for setting the look and feel of a website.It define the colour, size and position of text and other HTML tags, while the HTML files define the content and how it is organized. Separating them allows you to change the colour scheme without having to rewrite your entire website.Since it&#x27;s cascading, setting the colour of body text will mean all headings and paragraphs within the body will also be the same colour.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World&#x27;s first HTML site is still running, wanna check it out?
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;info.cern.ch&#x2F;hypertext&#x2F;WWW&#x2F;TheProject.html&quot;&gt;World&#x27;s First HTML Website&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-decentralized-platform-for-content-creators&quot;&gt;A decentralized platform for content creators.&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LBRY is a new protocol that allows people to build apps on the top of it which then can interact with the contents available on the LBRY network. LBRY allows the creators to set a price for the stream (Like I-tunes) or give out the video for free (like YouTube). You can publish any kind of file such as video, audio, text, documents, etc. It uses Blockchain technology for the creation of databases on the network.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monetization scheme for content on the LBRY protocol is also based on the Blockchain technology developed by the creator of Bitcoin. Unlike YouTube that serves you ads for monetization LBRY lets people themselves interact with the creators by giving them the ability to treat creators in the form of cryptocurrency (LBC) .&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all the tech giants today are centralized services that sells user&#x27;s personal information and attention to advertisers. But LBRY is a protocol making it a decentralized option for publishing contents. Since it&#x27;s decentralized it means that the content and your privacy is owned by you, not the tech giants whose service you use.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain technology like Bitcoin and LBRY enables people to create databases that no single entity controls.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Bitcoin, when you send money to someone, your computer broadcasts &amp;quot;hey, the person with this particular private key is sending money to that person over there&amp;quot; to the network, and the mining algorithm ensures everyone agrees that indeed, you sent that money, so your balance goes down and the recipient&#x27;s goes up.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In LBRY, the same mechanism is used to store an index of what content is available and how to download it, as well as financial transactions (such as tips, and purchases of paid content) using the Bitcoin-like currency LBC (LBRY Credits). When a creator publishes something on LBRY, an entry is made on the LBRY blockchain. You can think of it as an announcement: hey everyone, I&#x27;ve published this file, here&#x27;s some information about it, and instructions for how to download it from the peer-to-peer network.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;advantages&quot;&gt;Advantages&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&#x27;s free and open source.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no ads.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on a secure platform called Blockchain.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decentralized&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct interaction between fans and creators.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexibility of content and their file types&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free speech&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;disadvantages&quot;&gt;Disadvantages&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses cryptocurrency as money which is still not available in many countries.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comparatively slower than centralized platforms.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of popular content creators.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally it is used as an alternative to YouTube. And mostly video files are uploaded. There even is a feature to sync videos from your YouTube account to LBRY. You can access the LBRY content via the following apps and websites:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;apps&quot;&gt;Apps&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android : LBRY&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows : LBRY Desktop&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mac : LBRY Desktop&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using open source software is far better than using proprietary garbage. So this is one of my efforts to move to open source from a proprietary application that I use very often and love very much. Goodbye Evernote !&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;evernote&quot;&gt;Evernote&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the world&#x27;s most used note taking app. It&#x27;s simple yet powerful. You can use it for free on 3 devices with not much limitation from pro features. I have used Evernote (Free) since April 16th, 2018. It has been my must have tool for years. The data gets backed up in their server. It is fast and simple to sync my data even if I uninstalled the app. It has many tools to format the text as I like. It also has a web clipper that gets a webpage clipped on my note. It groups notes in notebooks and can tag them too.Overall it&#x27;s a powerful note taking app which is well designed and beautiful.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;joplin&quot;&gt;Joplin&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joplin is an open source note taking app having similar features to Evernote. It has the ability to backup your notes on the cloud of your choice. I even have an option to store my notes on their own cloud for some payment. The text formatting is done in markdown so it is sufficiently powerful for me. It also has a web clipper. it has the ability to group notes in Notebooks as well as tag them. It is one of the most powerful open source note taking application.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-recently-migrated-from-evernote-to-joplin-and-wanted-to-document-the-process-without-the-need-to-pay-for-syncing-notes-in-the-cloud-similar-to-evernote-free&quot;&gt;I recently migrated from Evernote to Joplin and wanted to document the process. ( Without the need to pay for syncing notes in the cloud similar to Evernote Free )&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;steps&quot;&gt;Steps&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-a-free-nextcloud-account-for-free-syncing&quot;&gt;Creating a Free Nextcloud Account (For free syncing)&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a free Nextcloud account is easy. First, sign up with your choice of server from the given link.
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nextcloud.com&#x2F;signup&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Sign up!&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
Then delete unwanted things from your Nextcloud storage (Optional). Normally you get 2 - 5 GB of free storage. That&#x27;s enough for keeping notes. You can keep other documents too if you want. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Specify the export folder.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do this for every Notebooks you want exported.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Navigate to the folder where you exported the notes from Evernote.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select and import the notes one-by-one.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After importing there might be some minor mis-formatting of text.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit your notes to be perfectly formatted.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;integrating-joplin-to-nextcloud&quot;&gt;Integrating Joplin to Nextcloud&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Check the synchronization, It should work !&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since you can see the whole source code of this OS you can swap out anything with anything. You can even change the desktop environment, window managers, display managers, init system etc which seem like core parts of the OS if you compare it with windows.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;immune-to-viruses&quot;&gt;Immune to Viruses&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are thousands of people watching the source code of linux, if one person tries to inject a virus or malware to the system , ten other people are there to remove it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;light-and-fast&quot;&gt;Light and Fast&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux is the fastest operating system in the world, you can make it run very less background processes as per your need and use a very little RAM for system and leave remaining ram to be used by additional applications making it even lighter and faster. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;privacy-respecting&quot;&gt;Privacy Respecting&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no telemetry enabled on any linux operating systems. If you want you can agree to send some data to them but it is turned off by default, unlike windows where each of their app have telemetry enabled by default.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;by-the-people-for-the-people&quot;&gt;By the People, For the People&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no headquarter of linux, it&#x27;s a community based OS which is improved and updated by communities if people. So no one needs to worry about sending your data to a giant data hogging company.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;compatibility&quot;&gt;Compatibility&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux is compatible with almost every kind of hardware, it can be designed to run on the servers, it can be designed to run on a supercomputer, a desktop, a laptop, a smartphone, a TV etc. Linux can literally run on a toaster.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;package-manager&quot;&gt;Package Manager&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The package manager on Linux is the best of it&#x27;s kind. You type simple command ( eg : apt install &lt;app&gt; ) on the terminal and &amp;quot;boom!&amp;quot; you got the app on your desktop. You can even update your whole system without needing to restart the machine, with a single command.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;versatility&quot;&gt;Versatility&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux is very versatile, it comes in hundreds of flavors. These flavors are called &#x27;distributions&#x27;. Distributions are based on different aspects, users, stability, updates, etc. You can choose to use a very stable Linux Distribution or you can choose to use a very updated Distribution. You can choose to use a user friendly Distribution as well as you can choose to just use the TUI without the GUI. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;foss&quot;&gt;FOSS&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux usually uses FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) which is usually free to use and gets your job done unlike windows where you pay for most of the softwares to work as well as don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on under the hood because you cannot see the source code.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;disadvantages&quot;&gt;Disadvantages&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;fragmentation&quot;&gt;Fragmentation&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main feature of Linux is also it&#x27;s disadvantage. The packaging system on Linux is different depending upon the distributions. Which requires the developers to port different types of packages for different distributions despite of being the same operating system.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;community&quot;&gt;Community&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the Linux community is a very helpful place where people can share ideas and problems which they solve as a team but sometimes The Linux community is one of the toxic places for people who are beginners. Most people assume themselves as superior because they use linux and refuse to help since they didn&#x27;t get any help when &amp;quot;they&amp;quot; learnt linux .&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;excessive-choices&quot;&gt;Excessive Choices&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many choices that a beginner gets overwhelmed with the options. The excess choice in everything also causes fear in the newcomer&#x27;s heart if they think they chose the wrong option.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;lack-of-some-professional-softwares&quot;&gt;Lack of Some Professional Softwares&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many professional softwares like Adobe Softwares, Microsoft Office, etc are not available in Linux. This can be a huge disadvantage if the user&#x27;s work totally depends upon these kinds of software.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;power-management&quot;&gt;Power Management&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux on laptops is a bit tricky because it uses a lot of power when installed draining the battery a lot faster than other operating systems. It doesn&#x27;t have a power saving algorithm like windows or mac does. But this issue can be somewhat fixed by installing additional battery saving softwares especially designed for laptops.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-thoughts&quot;&gt;My Thoughts&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally use and enjoy Linux as my daily driver. It is very fast compared to the windows operating system and I can do any kind of work from semi professional video editing on kdenlive to a simple note writing on kate on Linux. Sometimes there are bugs here and there but if everything was perfect where would be the room for development ? And finally , I use Arch BTW.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-open-network-for-secure-decentralized-communication&quot;&gt;An open network for secure, decentralized communication&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
┏━ ┏┳┓ ━┓
┃  ┃┃┃  ┃
┗━ ╹ ╹ ━┛

&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matrix is an open source project that publishes the Matrix open standard for secure, decentralized, real-time communication, and its Apache licensed reference implementations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gives you simple HTTP APIs and SDKs to create chatrooms, direct chats and chat bots, complete with end-to-end encryption, file transfer, synchronised conversation history, formatted messages, read receipts and more .&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;advantages&quot;&gt;Advantages&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;end-to-end-encryption&quot;&gt;End To End Encryption&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally the messages on matrix are end to end encrypted, meaning they can only be read by the recipients with the correct set of keys.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;bridges&quot;&gt;Bridges&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matrix can integrate with other chat services like IRC, Telegram, Discord etc by the means of bridges. With bridges you can send messages to a telegram group bridged to matrix and they can see and reply back easily.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;decentralized&quot;&gt;Decentralized&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matrix has no specific server nor it has a specific app. It is decentralized which makes it safer than the centralized messaging services offered by giant data hogging companies like Facebook, Discord, etc.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;voip&quot;&gt;VoIP&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matrix offers VoIP service which means that you can make high quality audio and video calls over the internet and still using an open source and decentralized platform.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-centric&quot;&gt;User Centric&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matrix can offer what the user want. If you want unencrypted messages? You can. If you want a different server? You can. If you want a different application? You can. You have the ability to make your own server, even design a whole application if you can, the possibilities are endless.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;disadvantages&quot;&gt;Disadvantages&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;difficult-to-understand&quot;&gt;Difficult to Understand&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of Decentralization, Federation and Multiple servers can be a bit difficult to handle by a normal brain, especially if they haven&#x27;t heard about it before. Also the encryption on matrix is very good which takes us to a famous saying, &amp;quot;Privacy comes with a cost of convenience.&amp;quot;. Since every client should be verified with backup keys or use another login to to verify the new one, it becomes a bit difficult than other services like Facebook , Discord which just need you to input your ID and password to login and see all the chats.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;uncertainty-of-servers&quot;&gt;Uncertainty of Servers&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Servers are the places where you have your account and where you communicate from. It&#x27;s like a village where you live, but the servers can go out of fund or the administrator may lose interest and &amp;quot;Your village may get destructed.&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;lack-of-users&quot;&gt;Lack of Users&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the people that use matrix are tech enthusiasts, open source supporters, privacy enthusiasts, and other people (ahmm ! Basically Nerds!). You might not find the people whom you usually talk to in Matrix.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall Matrix is very good alternative to other chat services like telegram, signal, messenger, etc. It is very flexible as well as secure which makes it better than all others. And since it&#x27;s a developing project there are much more features to come. Different clients also are developing &amp;quot;default&amp;quot; features of messaging apps like voice message and other features making easier for the people to shift from their existing platform too if you feel like switching.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open source is source code that is made freely available to be modified by the public as well as can be redistributed. It is a decentralized software development model that encourage people for open collaboration. It began as a response to the limitation and weakness of the &amp;quot;closed source&amp;quot; proprietary code. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, open source refers to a computer program whose source code is available to the public for use or modification from its initial design. Code is released under the terms of a software license. Depending on the license terms, people can download, modify, and publish their version (fork) back to the community.Open source software is usually a free software product, where people have access to the source code. They can enhance the program’s performance, add some features, and fix errors. Some examples of such software are LibreOffice, Firefox, and VLC Media Player.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;everything-has-it-s-own-pros-and-cons-here-are-some-of-the-pros-and-cons-of-open-source&quot;&gt;Everything has it&#x27;s own pros and cons. Here are some of the pros and cons of Open Source :&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros :&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaboration between different peoples can bring new ideas that can be implemented on it leading to better software.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is secure to use because anyone can look what&#x27;s going behind the scenes unlike proprietary softwares.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the code can be modified by anyone, anyone can customize it to their own liking.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually free to use.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You actually can own your software instead of renting it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons :&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercialization is difficult to achieve.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fragmentation of software if a person doesn&#x27;t like what the original community is doing. ( This can also be an advantage of Open Source, depending upon people&#x27;s perspective. )&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is always the possibility that the developers of a program lose interest in working further on the software or just move on to another project.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike proprietary softwares where you can phone or email them for instant tech support open source doesn&#x27;t have a proper tech support medium.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think you are private and secure then think again. Do you use a smartphone? Do you use Google ? Do you use Facebook ?  If yes, your privacy has definitely been compromised. Your data might also have been leaked in one of the many data breaches throughout years. Every time you turn on the location of your device, every time you give google permission to your device&#x27;s sensors it&#x27;s collecting some data and sending it to google&#x27;s servers. Your data can be used by many ways by these organizations. For giving recommendations on YouTube that you might love watching to selling you products that you don&#x27;t even need.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had a conversation around your phone about &#x27;something&#x27;, then later saw an advertisement on Facebook or Instagram for that same &#x27;something&#x27;? Trust me it isn&#x27;t coincidence.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google employees can even access users&#x27; email to delete virus&#x27;, or remove potentially unsafe or violent emails. Emails are considered as one of the most private medium of communicating. Guess what, Google employees can access that without a warrant. All comes down to that one part where you have signed the agreement clause when you created your account.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On his blog by David Evenden he says, &amp;quot; I would nearly guarantee all email vendors are the same way. They&#x27;ll say they can&#x27;t, they&#x27;ll say they don&#x27;t...but trust me...they can and they do.&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;there-are-more-scary-things&quot;&gt;There are more scary things :&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are always listened by any smart device that has microphone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your GPS is always tracking you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of your messages are not encrypted.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything you say anywhere in the internet can be collected, and can be used to track, stalk, steal, and monitor your activity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically you are being sold to companies without even knowing it. Your info brings money to them. How else do you think free to use services companies like Google, Facebook, etc earn money? I am not a security expert but I can say that I have done a good amount of research on this issue. Nothing is free in the internet, your information is more valuable than any form of money.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;you-might-not-be-able-completely-vanish-from-the-internet-but-here-are-some-things-you-can-do-to-increase-your-non-existent-privacy-as-well-as-security-to-a-certain-extent&quot;&gt;You might not be able completely vanish from the internet. But here are some things you can do to increase your non existent privacy as well as security to a certain extent.&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop using Google,Facebook, Microsoft and their services.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give priority to open source software.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use different passwords  for different accounts and make them complex. (or use trusted password managers)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use two factor authentication.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never install and run applications from an un-trusted source.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always read the user agreements before agreeing to something.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turn off as much telemetry as you can.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never save passwords inside your browser.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prefer decentralized social media and encrypted  messaging services.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always give minimum information about you to the sites you visit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot more to this problem, this is just the tip of an iceberg. Privacy is the main currency in today&#x27;s world. It&#x27;s up-to us how we choose to keep our information. Just knowing this may not change your daily routine about how you use the internet but you&#x27;ll learn what&#x27;s happening behind the bars. Some of the things mentioned above maybe very difficult to implement. But that&#x27;s the cost of privacy ; you need to trade some convenience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Custom ROMs</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-better-alternative-to-stock-roms&quot;&gt;A Better Alternative to Stock ROMs.&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Android is an open source operating system, anybody can check and modify it&#x27;s source code. You yourself can modify it as per your liking if you know what you are doing. Custom ROMs are the product of the openness of  Android. If you have noticed, when you use a Samsung phone it feels different than a phone from Xaomi which is also one of the blessings of an open software. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Custom ROMs are the modified versions of the original Android operating system that can be installed in place of the Stock ROMs ( The OS that&#x27;s already present on your device when you bought it. ) . Custom ROMs can be very beneficial if your phone supports it. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;advantages&quot;&gt;Advantages&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;latest-and-greatest&quot;&gt;Latest and Greatest&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your manufacturer stopped sending software updates for your phone then you can get the latest version of android if you install a custom ROMs on it. And since it will be how android was originally made you won&#x27;t get bloatware and ads on your system apps that you normally see on generally every Stock ROM.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;versatility&quot;&gt;Versatility&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many Custom ROMs that you can choose from. Each of them are unique in  their own ways. They differ from features, battery life, performance, etc.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;privacy-and-security&quot;&gt;Privacy and Security&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Custom ROMs have Google services scraped out from them, that alone is the biggest feature for a privacy-centric device. They come preinstalled with open source alternatives of the propitiatory apps that can get your job done. Some ROMs even give their own services for cloud storage, emails etc. making them more privacy focused. You generally get the fastest security updates making your phone less vulnerable to malwares and bugs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;custom-kernel&quot;&gt;Custom Kernel&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different ROMs use different kernels ( The part of an operating that is directly connected to the hardware and is responsible for controlling it ). Kernel is heavily responsible for the experience you get from your device.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;improved-performance&quot;&gt;Improved Performance&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Custom ROMs offer you improved performance - definitely better than the Stock ROM that your manufacturer offers you. It is due to the fact that all the bloat are removed , latest version of android is present and the processor is overclocked.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;improved-battery-life&quot;&gt;Improved Battery Life&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since all the bloat and ads are removed the background processes on your device gets substantially reduced that adds up extra life to your device. And you can even under-clock your processor that helps a lot to gain more battery life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;customization-and-uniqueness&quot;&gt;Customization and Uniqueness&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending upon the Custom ROMs you get different levels of customization as well as you get a unique looking UI which you cannot get on any Stock ROM. You can entirely hide the icons on status bar, change the boot animation, apply system wide themes, the possibilities are endless.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;disadvantages&quot;&gt;Disadvantages&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;widewine-l1&quot;&gt;Widewine L1&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your ROM might not have widewine L1 support making you unable to view HD content on  applications like Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc. You will have to root and do the modifications or wait for a software update that enables it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;safetynet&quot;&gt;SafetyNet&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your ROM may fail to verify SafetyNet, not being able to install certain apps especially banking apps if you use them frequently. This also can be fixed by rooting and doing the modifications.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;only-for-snapdragon-and-exynos-processors&quot;&gt;Only For Snapdragon and Exynos Processors&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MediaTek in terms of Source Code has a policy, of not distributing it for free just to anyone unlike Snapdragon and Exynos processors. So there cannot be Custom ROMs designed for MediaTek unless they clarify themselves as opensource, or someone buys the source code from them and gives it to the developers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;camera-with-less-software-optimization&quot;&gt;Camera With Less Software Optimization&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally the camera apps of Custom ROMs are poor in terms of software optimizations and versatility. This issue can be fixed by installing Gcam ( Which might even have better software optimization than your Custom ROM offered. ). You also have the ability to install ANX Camera ( MIUI Camera for Xaomi Devices ) but it require you to flash files from a custom recovery or via Magisk after rooting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;root-access&quot;&gt;Root Access&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Custom ROMs require you to have root access to work that can add a big vulnerability to your device since it opens up your system directories that might cause all your data to be leaked if a malicious app got access to it. This can be prevented by your efforts of not letting any malicious apps to get into your device and access root level permissions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Note :-&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing a Custom ROM require you to to unlock your device&#x27;s boot-loader. The method and process of unlocking the boot-loader completely depends upon the manufacturer ( Some doesn&#x27;t even give you the ability to do so. ). You might also need to install a custom recovery for the installation. If not done with proper care and knowledge you might brick your device during the process. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tildeverse is a free and open association of like minded tilde (~) communities. Tildes are pubnixes - (Public Access Unix Systems) inspired by tilde.club which was created by Paul Ford in 2014. These are very useful to those who want to learn about *nix 
(GNU&#x2F;Linux, Unix, BSD, etc) systems. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s name is a combination of &#x27;Tilde (~)&#x27; and &#x27;Universe&#x27;. Here, Tilde means &#x27;Home&#x27; because (~) is a sign that represents the home directory in *nix systems.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pubnixes - (Public Access Unix Systems) in simple terms are computers across the world that can be accessed via the internet. These computer run *nix operating systems and are accessed using Secure Shell (SSH).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;people-can-use-it-to&quot;&gt;People Can Use It To :&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;build-webpages&quot;&gt;Build Webpages&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can create their own websites for free. Most tildes provide a folder where you can create and store a .html file which automatically becomes a website ( Domain is determined by respective tilde communities where you signed up. ) and can be instantly viewed it by  going to the assigned web address.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;build-gemini-capsules&quot;&gt;Build Gemini Capsules&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like normal websites Gemini capsules also are &amp;quot;websites&amp;quot; on a different protocol called Gemini. People can host their Gemini Capsules like they can host websites.  Tildes provide a folder where you can create and store a .gmi file which automatically becomes a capsule and can be instantly viewed by going to the assigned gemini address.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;build-gopher-holes&quot;&gt;Build Gopher Holes&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like gemini capsules gopher holes also are &amp;quot;websites&amp;quot; on a different protocol called Gopher. People can host their Gopher Holes like they can host websites.  Tildes provide a folder where you can create and store a text file which automatically becomes a gopher hole and can be instantly viewed by going to the assigned gopher address.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;learn-to-use-nix&quot;&gt;Learn to use nix*&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 70 percentage of people in the world are using Windows as their OS and many don&#x27;t even know what an OS is, these computers on the other hand runs nix*. Nix* includes operating systems like GNU&#x2F;Linux, BSD, Unix etc. These are generally used in servers; most of the servers runs GNU&#x2F;Linux. People can learn to navigate between files and folders and use terminal based applications provided by the tildes helping to grasp how *nix is designed and organized.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;write-software&quot;&gt;Write Software&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tildes provide people with a suite of programs by which they can write software and learn. People can write code in Vim as well as Nano if  preferred. They can ask the administrator to install specific programs of their tilde doesn&#x27;t have one.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;play-tui-games&quot;&gt;Play TUI games&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TUI stands for Text User Interface; like GUI - Graphical User Interface. Since It doesn&#x27;t have a GUI, people are limited to the games that are made for TUI and also to the games that are provided respective tilde.  One of the common games on tildes is &#x27;botany&#x27; where people grow a plant, water it, crossbreed it, exchange seeds with friends etc.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conduct-shows&quot;&gt;Conduct Shows&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can even conduct web radio shows ( AzuraCast Streams ) on tildes, particularly on tilderadio.org if you are interested in it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-tilde-services-and-projects&quot;&gt;Use Tilde Services and Projects&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services like  tilde-chat, tilde-git, tilde-radio, mastodon, writefreely, minecraft, tilde-news,tildeverse jitsi, tildeverse mumble etc are available to use for tilde users to communicate and interact with each other.  For more info about services go to :
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tildeverse.org&quot;&gt;Tildeverse&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basically, It is a unified hub of decentralized services and pubnixes where people can use their nerdy programs, do their nerdy works, interact with similar nerdy peoples having fun and learning.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;difference-between-tildes&quot;&gt;Difference Between Tildes&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services like Emails, NNTP, PHP etc are offered by limited tildes. For example, ~town does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; offer email at all (only internal mail), cosmic could only send&#x2F;receive emails in Tildeverse. NNTP service is only natively offered by ~club, ~team, cosmic, and your~.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Softwares like weechat, botany, etc are available in limited tildes. This is also determined by the operating system used in them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different tildes use different Operating Systems that determine the shell, applications, usability etc.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tildes are located all over the world, so there is also a difference of geographical location where a certain tilde is located.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tildes have their own specific themes, cosmic.voyage have a science fiction based theme, breadcrumb have a baker kind of theme, etc.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particular tildes have particular objectives and specific tasks like ~radio, ~chat, etc.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~team provides XMPP service that bridges to ~chat  and envs.net do Matrix bridging.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-nix-though&quot;&gt;Why nix* though ?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section from Paul Ford&#x27;s essay about tildeverse explains :&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;message&#x2F;tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf&quot;&gt;Full Essay&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your typical &amp;quot;cloud&amp;quot; Unix server, designed in the 1970s to be a very social place, is today a ghost town with one or two factories still clanking in the town square - factories that receive our email, or accept our Instagram photos and store them, and manage our data. But there&#x27;s no one walking around and chatting downtown.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus when people talk about &amp;quot;cloud computing&amp;quot; they are talking about millions of tiny ghost towns. Ironic, because what do people build on these ghost towns but social networks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last decade, social networks like Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook - even Google Plus appeared. They tried to bring all those lonesome folks back together, into one enormous room. Not just a few dozen people on one computer but millions, even a billion people all sharing one giant meta-computer. Many of those services make very heavy use of Unix under the hood. So: We collectively took a very social computing platform, papered over its social parts, and used it to build a social computing platform.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purely for kicks, I decided to turn the social part back on and throw
a nerd party.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-secure-decentralized-social-network&quot;&gt;A Secure Decentralized Social Network.&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastodon is a federated social media platform ( Actually a microblogging platform similar to Twitter ) based on a communication protocol called Activity Pub. It was released on 16th March 2016 and was created to be a safe place to share Ideas between people without having to trust a single organization for all your data. It is a free and open source software and can be used to self host social networking service so that you have the option to keep your data with you or with whom you trust.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Federation&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greatest feature of mastodon is it&#x27;s federated nature. Mastodon doesn&#x27;t have a single server that store and moderates the data coming in and going out from it unlike Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or any other centralized platforms have. Which gives you the option to choose who to trust with your data and why.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instances&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastodon has many servers with their own moderator(s) all around the globe hosted by different organizations with different mindset and different regulations. These servers are known as Instances which can be categorised by the topics,places, ethnicity, etc. So they don&#x27;t have a single set of rules and regulations but have different rules on different instances making communication between known and unknown communities easier.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moderation&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different instances have different populations and are moderated by different moderators which makes it easier to reach the users and respond to their issue. If a instance has 1000 peoples and two moderators, a moderators should only have to moderate 500 peoples, since the moderators are also the active members of the community who constantly interact with what is happening in the community they can solve the issues of the users in a more systematic and timely manner. On the other hand Twitter like platforms mostly use AI to moderate and the issues might take days or even weeks to get responded. There are times when people are responded for their issues by their moderators within minutes in mastodon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it is based on Activity Pub anyone can communicate with anyone on the other instance or even with other platforms like pleroma and peertube( based on Activity Pub ) from a single mastodon account without having to make different accounts for different platforms in order to communicate with the people in that platform ( Like you need a seperate accounts to follow users in different platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube ,etc. )&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexibility&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastodon includes a number of specific privacy features. Each message has a variety of privacy options available, and users can choose whether the message is public or private. Public messages display on a global feed, known as a timeline, and private messages are only shared on the timelines of the user&#x27;s followers. Messages can also be marked as unlisted from timelines or direct between users. Users can also mark their accounts as completely private. In the timeline, polls can also be made and you can also create messages that can be displayed with an optional &amp;quot;content warning&amp;quot; feature, which requires readers to click on the content to reveal the rest of the message. Mastodon servers have used this feature to hide spoilers, trigger warnings, and not safe for work (NSFW) content, though some accounts use the feature to hide links and thoughts others might not want to read.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fediverse is an interconnected network of different services like Social Networking, Microblogging, Blogging, Video Hosting, File Hosting, and other services which can be independently hosted on different servers but can still communicate with each other. A service client can have multiple (hundreds and thousands) servers across the globe (called Instances) where each Instance (Server) has their own rules and regulations. 
And since all the servers are running on a same base communication protocol they can communicate outside the boundaries of the servers and instances too. These services are connected in such a manner that a video hosting platform can communicate with a photo sharing platform or with a microblogging platform or any other platform. Every platform on fediverse can communicate with any other platform on the fediverse if they use the same communication protocol. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most famous communication protocol of fediverse is Activity Pub. It is implemented on different softwares like Mastodon, Pleroma, Nextcloud, Peertube etc. There also are different communication protocols like Disapora Network, Zot and OStatus implemented on softwares like Friendica and Disapora*.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These softwares are open source and anyone can create their own server if they have sufficient will and resources. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find me on a microblogging platform inside the fediverse called Mastodon : @scientiac@fosstodon.org&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more I think about it, the more it becomes clear that you are the most loving and my favorite person. I remember those days in Bhirgaun and gulp thinking those days were too good and will not return back. I think about how we played hide and seek, made temples under the flower bush and get overwhelmed by the warmth it brings to my heart. I remember how we played;  you being teacher and I being a student  , you being my mother and I being your son , you being my wife and I being your husband. I remember sleeping on your lap while you played with my hair. I still remember you as that little girl who herself is scared but catches my hand to comfort me while I was scared of the imaginary ghosts from the stories told by Sudip. I remember coming to your house and staying the night talking to you when I didn&#x27;t get a phone to use WI-FI. I remember being compared to you as we were on same grade and I didn&#x27;t get top three position on exam while you stood first.I remember everytime I met you I kissed you on your cheeks and you wiped it. I remember you being angry and scolding me and the next minute we were talking about how we liked each other. I remember you skipping to another grade and actually being senior to me (You wouldn&#x27;t know how angry I was that day.). I remember you leaving Dharan and being far from me when we didn&#x27;t even had WIFI to communicate. I remember being lonely and sad when I went to your house and you weren&#x27;t there (I still do). &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since those Days we may be far from each other but I still love you the most . I still think about you and want you to call me, let me sleep on your lap and want you play with my hair while we share our stories , I want you to shout at me when I make mistakes and hit my stupid head while I irritate you with my weird interests. I am what I am because you were already in this world when I just came. Not every birthday can be special but some birthdays can. I want you to feel special  today because today is the day I love the most (even though I don&#x27;t remember the date). &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this capsule I make my most special person more special by making you the  first person in the world to get a birthday wish from this protocol. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With love,
~ Spu&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-middle-ground-between-gopher-and-the-modern-web&quot;&gt;A Middle Ground Between Gopher and The Modern Web.&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gemini is a internet protocol started in June 2019 that is similar to Gopher or as they call it &amp;quot;The web, stripped right back to its essence&amp;quot;.
Gemini can be seen as a middle ground between the old gopher protocol of the early 1990s and the modern web (http and https).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike http(s) it is text only, that means it only supports information in the form of text following the UNIX philosophy (Make each program do one thing well).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s a place you can be if you don&#x27;t want resource intensive things going on in your server and if you don&#x27;t have anything to do with media streaming(of course you can put media files in it but the files should be downloaded in order to view them). Since it is text only, it is very accessable for anyone with a computer, even a potato computing device can access the information stored and shared using this protocol.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pages of Gemini are called &amp;quot;capsules&amp;quot; named after the Gemini space capsule. These capsules are written on a format similar to markdown with file extension &amp;quot;.gmi&amp;quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am and will be yours and you are mine until the end. We are one single person, and will always be. Will never ever break apart. I vow to never leave you in your darkest times as well as mine. I will always be there with you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am I in this dark quiet place. Silence everywhere, why can&#x27;t I feel my heart beating ? Why the soil is not making any sound as I walk in it. Why is nobody here! Hello!! &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s been days, maybe weeks , why don&#x27;t I feel any hunger, thirst, not even tiredness. Am I alive or am I not? What&#x27;s that light over there ? Hello!!!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flash!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why can&#x27;t I touch you? Why do you look soo old? Why is that bulb glowing soo white instead of yellow? Is that a calendar? It&#x27;s been 10 years? Where are all the photos of mine? Is that your diary? What do you mean you waited? 
What is that mark on your neck? It looks like a healed cut. 
Hello???!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wasn&#x27;t a hallucination? So, am I actually dead? Why am I seeing her? And who&#x27;s that guy? Heyy!!, can anyone hear me!!? I&#x27;m up here! Wait, Are they kissing? How am I suddenly able to read minds? &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has gone through too much. She attempted suicide? Oh, that&#x27;s what the mark is. So, she met him two years ago on the same graveyard where I was buried.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He too knows what it feels to lose a loved one. His girlfriend died of brain tumor. Ohh so, he plays guitar too. Ahh those good old days.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, what have I become? What am I now? What is the purpose of my existence? Maybe there&#x27;s no reason at all.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I just a part of me that lives in her. Maybe this is my life after I am dead. I&#x27;m an infection inside her brain, the infection that has the ability to form into a tumor. I have the potential to kill her and maybe, maybe we can be together again, should I? But, what&#x27;s life then? Isn&#x27;t it the hope of being alive and trying to fulfill your dreams? What&#x27;s life without some pain, some wounds, some scratches and bruises that makes you feel more alive. She got the opportunity to live it the way it was intended, I didn&#x27;t. Yeah she is actually alive, the aliveness
that comes killing the pain, healing the wounds as the tears dry up. She&#x27;s alive, alive with new hope, with new feelings, a new start. 
As she heals from her never-known disease , me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Maybe, it&#x27;s not&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Maybe It&#x27;s only about me&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It&#x27;s about how I followed you&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
How I loved you&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
How we were together&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
How I felt when you disappeared&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Wait,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Maybe its all about you&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
About how you didn&#x27;t notice me&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
How you lived your life flying and playing&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
How you didn&#x27;t care&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
How you enjoyed the day and night&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
How I didn&#x27;t matter&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Or&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Maybe its about them&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
About how they made fun of us&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
How they made us different&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
How they manipulated our mind&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
How they used us both&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
How they took us apart&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Clearly&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
This was a heaven&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A heaven of hope&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Where you were a firefly&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
An innocent little beauty&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Where I was the night&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Dark cold and empty&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And they were the rain&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A cruel endless rain&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Because,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
We were destined to meet tomorrow.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A new day with a new hope&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Where I hoped to meet you&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
See you dancing&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
In your own small world&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
but all that&#x27;s left was hope&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Not just any hope&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
But a false hope&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A hope that broke my heart&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A hope which hid the pain of truth&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A hope that was toxic&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A hope which pushed me&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Far from your presence&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Far far away from you&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Far from the world of fireflies&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Far far away from my firefly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

a feeling of satisfaction, relaxation.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;

You flow with a unpredictable turbulence,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A wise old man once said and I quote,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She didn&#x27;t break my heart, she just made me very sad that my dopamine levels got very low. The only thing that could help to increase my dopamine and serotonin levels was to eat food. Excessive intake of so called &amp;quot;Tasty&amp;quot; food containing excess amount of saturated fat and cholesterol caused plaques to build up in my arteries.
Due to the buildup of plaque, my arteries started to narrow down, decreasing the blood flow to my heart. The reduced blood flow caused chest pain, shortness of breath and other problems. Days passed by, but the plaque gradually went on increasing. One day I woke up and found out that I was unconscious for 2 days. The plaque had completely blocked one of my arteries. I had a heart attack . She didn&#x27;t break my heart but she gave me a heart attack.&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was about to ask how the heck was he still alive, but my alarm went off and I woke up.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Torrent and Torrenting</title>
		<published>2020-11-13T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2020-11-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://scientiac.space/blog/torrenting/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://scientiac.space/blog/torrenting/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-decentralized-file-transfer-protocol-and-activity&quot;&gt;A decentralized file transfer protocol and activity.&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Torrents are a method of distributing files over the internet. They operate over the BitTorrent protocol. The BitTorrent protocol helps in sharing data in a decentralized manner.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Torrenting is the process of downloading and hosting torrents using the BitTorrent protocol.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;workings-of-torrenting&quot;&gt;Workings of Torrenting&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is done by breaking down large files into many bits and later connecting those bits together. Torrenting works by using decentralized servers to download files, and each participant in this file-sharing activity is engaged in downloading and uploading files. That is to say, all Torrent users rely on each other to carry on the file transfer activity. Essentially, you are sharing the file being downloaded while it is still in the process of downloading, without having to wait for the whole file to download.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A single person uploads a file (Makes a torrent).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A torrent can be distributed using a hash; often called a magnet link or a TORRENT file.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The file is downloaded by another person.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The device of another person now acts as a server and involves in the supplying of that file too.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the number of people downloading the file increases, the number of servers increases, making it better available when one or more server is inactive or disconnected.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the file was broken into pieces, some pieces of the file goes from one server and some from another, sharing the bandwidth with the main server.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;terms-in-torrenting&quot;&gt;Terms in Torrenting&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;seed&quot;&gt;Seed&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the user downloads a torrent and the torrent client starts uploading the file for other people to download, the file the downloader is uploading which is available for other users to download from is a seed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;peer&quot;&gt;Peer&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A peer is someone downloading the file from a seeder and does not have the full file yet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;leech&quot;&gt;Leech&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a user downloads a torrent but refuses to distribute it then the file is called a leech (Maybe the user is called a leech.).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;swarm&quot;&gt;Swarm&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A swarm is a group of people who are sharing and downloading the same toerrent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;tracker&quot;&gt;Tracker&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a server that tracks the users of the torrent and helps to locate each other for data transmission.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;client&quot;&gt;Client&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A client is a program that recognizes the torrent file or the magnet hash and does the downloading and uploading task.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;indexers&quot;&gt;Indexers&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indexers are the websites that collects and stores a huge number of torrents. It&#x27;s where the people search for the torrent they require.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-torrneting-illegal&quot;&gt;Is Torrneting Illegal ?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is the most asked question, I am just going to tell you that torrenting isn&#x27;t illegal. But....... There&#x27;s a but. Downloading and distributing illegal (Copyrighted) files via the torrent is illegal. Torrent is just a file transfer protocol.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

The sun goes down and then comes night.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
No light , no colors, lack of sight,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The only colors left are black and white.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is dark and colors are gone,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The sky turns black in the absence of sun.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The moon and the stars rise in the sky,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
What also rise are millions of &amp;quot;why ?&amp;quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every night I see those stars,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And wonder how many there are.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Yes, they are huge but they are far,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
All I see is the past of the stars.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some red , some blue and others are white,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Reds are far &amp;amp; blues are near says the light.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
There&#x27;s one Moon but stars infinite,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
All of these shows the beauty of night.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
