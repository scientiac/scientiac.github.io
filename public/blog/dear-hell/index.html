    <meta name="description" content="All the times, I smile, the thoughts.
Every time, I wish those, feelings.
Many times, I wonder, emotions.
Make my life, heaven, hey Hell!
The hope to win, their heart, their fake gods.
I&#x27;ve been Lost in time, no space, my free soul.
Things I&#x27;ve done, till now, the good deeds.
Wishes my soul, in Dise, oh Hell please!
Burning in the flames of fire, one, I feel.
The ice cold blistering curse, two, the itch.
Torture and pain to purify, three, my heart.
Being eaten alive, no mercy, a new birth!
Think I&#x27;m going one hell, many choices.
One where Christians go, is it, the Hell.
Or be it in the Hindus, they say, Narak.
May be it&#x27;s them, Islam,  Jahannam!
Choice and chances, I see it, the truth.
Feels like I&#x27;m in it, sometimes, my ruth.
I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m going, to one, I bet.
All hail to it, null heart, true hell!
Sins all those, I&#x27;ve done, to them.
Brings my soul, near you, to pure.
Chop me into, pieces, ream me.
Then you&#x27;ll see, the good, in me!
Kills and flesh, the blood, torn wide.
Things I think, the ways, dark side.
Greed and jealousy, the thoughts, kill me.
Dear Hell, I only trust you, clean me!
