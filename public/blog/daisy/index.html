    <meta name="description" content="My hands are frozen, and my heart shivers.
My eyes are in pain, my brain just jitters.
I&#x27;ve been scared, and I cannot feel a thing.
Am I awake? Cause this feels like a dream.
Those ordinary days, I just used to chill.
Endless possibilities, I&#x27;ve begun to feel.
If this than that, the world revolves to it.
One inevitable rule, that I tried to cheat.
The world&#x27;s broken, my head&#x27;s full of flaws.
As I tried things, broken were those laws.
A step at a time, I&#x27;m losing all my grasp.
I trust people, keep falling for those traps.
A thousand times I think, to decide a blink.
Where else do I seek, just to find the link.
Should take on the hits, if you are in lead.
Let others leave, while you fight to bleed.
Why should I believe, anything you say.
Cause it&#x27;s every day, people come and play.
But all hope isn&#x27;t lost, though it&#x27;s not the same.
It remains in the fire, as the heat to your flame.
Grow up with pain; cold, droughts and in rain.
All the things you&#x27;ve seen, won&#x27;t just go in vain.
Some good it remains, in people that I know.
Daisies as they are, everywhere they&#x27;ll grow.
