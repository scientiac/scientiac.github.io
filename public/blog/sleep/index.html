    <meta name="description" content="Bye! goodnight, It&#x27;s time, to sleep.
Then, flash bright, I dive, void deep.
Fine, my mind, it&#x27;s hard, to keep.
Cry, not loud, damp out, just weep.
Poems, I write, with thoughts, so sad.
Life, I like, it&#x27;s not, that bad.
You, that&#x27;s right, the smile, you have.
Us, we met, that&#x27;s why, I&#x27;m glad.
Dreams, sometimes, I see, you there.
Feels, my heart, it&#x27;s beats, unclear.
Smile, I do, when you, are near.
Glows, your eyes, it&#x27;s why, I care.
Fear, It&#x27;s gone, butterflies, all around.
Wish, came true, fly high, to clouds.
Leave, when you, my heart, it pounds.
Lean, on me, each other, we&#x27;ve found.
Wait! don&#x27;t leave, stay here, some more.
Talk, we will, till we, feel bore.
Shies, the stars, our smiles, before.
Seeing, you happy, I adore, amor.
Things, you talk, sometimes, wordplay.
Trends, I learn&#x27;t, makes sense, now they.
Voice, my style, it&#x27;s modern, I&#x27;ll say.
Purr! my queen, go girl! you slayy.
