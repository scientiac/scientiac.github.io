Does he see darkness like I do
or does he feel colors through his ears?
I wonder what a deaf woman hears.
Does she feel silence like I do
or does she enjoy music with her eyes?
I wonder what a dead person thinks.
Does it think of nothingness which I can&#x27;t
or does it think with it&#x27;s soul flying? Up! up in the sky.
I&#x27;m Unexperienced, I don&#x27;t know any.
Lost inside the wonders that my brain creates.
Is there a way to feel what others do? No!
There&#x27;s no good or bad in wondering.
The people dying in my head when they are late.
It&#x27;s just my own brain trying to scare itself.
I get overly excited wondering a thing.
A thing that&#x27;s close to impossible, soo close.
And then I am demolished by the same impossibility.
The positives and negatives of wonder.
They are contained within themselves.
All the difference is made by the truth I expect.
But all the unreality breaks down in a while.
I snap back into existence, the real world.
Where the world is driven by it. Yes, wonders!
I wonder what I could be if ……………………
