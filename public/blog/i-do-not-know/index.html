    <meta name="description" content="I wish my wish never comes true,
and this life I was never born to,
that the bang had never happened,
and I could see the true present.
I wish for God&#x27;s free will to play,
and I lost half my life each day,
that I knew the unknown unknowns,
could borrow the time, like a loan.
Wish I could move the immovable,
want to be in the top of the world,
wish I could travel back in time,
and for I could undo my crimes.
I could make everyone agree,
and could control what I see,
control minds, mine and then others,
visualize what all universe covers,
Learn a lesson with no failure,
to every problem, there was a cure,
wishes came true, when I want to,
the night, bright and the day was blue.
Wish I knew each name and face,
no knowledge left for me to chase,
wish to move mountains with ease,
and make the impossibles a breeze.
To swim, in the depths of the sun,
and rewrite the laws that have begun,
wish to be both here and there,
to travel beyond without a care.
To know everything without learning,
and forget nothing without burning,
but as I wish for things so grand,
I feel the weight of time and sand.
I&#x27;ll grasp at straws and hold onto hope,
that someday, somehow, I&#x27;ll learn to cope,
for wishes alone just cannot bring,
the power to do impossible things.
