you&#x27;re different each day, like lua&#x27;s phases,
the craters I see, are your subtle dimples,
your shiny eyes, the moon glowing bright.
I compare you with the daisy in the wild,
you smile for no reason, like daisies bloom,
their dance with wind, is you being yourself,
your simple heart, it&#x27;s what they represent.
I compare you to the poems that I write,
you&#x27;re the only one, like the rhymes I rhyme,
worlds they contain, are your favorite places,
your cute smile, is what they always seek.
I compare you with me and my nuances,
you complete me, just like I want you to do,
my weird views, are like &amp;quot;em&amp;quot; trends you follow,
you yourself, is who I&#x27;m entangled with.
