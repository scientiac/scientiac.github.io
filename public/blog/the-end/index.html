    <meta name="description" content="I am and will be yours and you are mine until the end. We are one single person, and will always be. Will never ever break apart. I vow to never leave you in your darkest times as well as mine. I will always be there with you.
Why am I in this dark quiet place. Silence everywhere, why can&#x27;t I feel my heart beating ? Why the soil is not making any sound as I walk in it. Why is nobody here! Hello!! 
It&#x27;s been days, maybe weeks , why don&#x27;t I feel any hunger, thirst, not even tiredness. Am I alive or am I not? What&#x27;s that light over there ? Hello!!!
Flash!
Why can&#x27;t I touch you? Why do you look soo old? Why is that bulb glowing soo white instead of yellow? Is that a calendar? It&#x27;s been 10 years? Where are all the photos of mine? Is that your diary? What do you mean you waited? 
What is that mark on your neck? It looks like a healed cut. 
Hello???!
This wasn&#x27;t a hallucination? So, am I actually dead? Why am I seeing her? And who&#x27;s that guy? Heyy!!, can anyone hear me!!? I&#x27;m up here! Wait, Are they kissing? How am I suddenly able to read minds? 
She has gone through too much. She attempted suicide? Oh, that&#x27;s what the mark is. So, she met him two years ago on the same graveyard where I was buried.
He too knows what it feels to lose a loved one. His girlfriend died of brain tumor. Ohh so, he plays guitar too. Ahh those good old days.
After all, what have I become? What am I now? What is the purpose of my existence? Maybe there&#x27;s no reason at all.
Am I just a part of me that lives in her. Maybe this is my life after I am dead. I&#x27;m an infection inside her brain, the infection that has the ability to form into a tumor. I have the potential to kill her and maybe, maybe we can be together again, should I? But, what&#x27;s life then? Isn&#x27;t it the hope of being alive and trying to fulfill your dreams? What&#x27;s life without some pain, some wounds, some scratches and bruises that makes you feel more alive. She got the opportunity to live it the way it was intended, I didn&#x27;t. Yeah she is actually alive, the aliveness
that comes killing the pain, healing the wounds as the tears dry up. She&#x27;s alive, alive with new hope, with new feelings, a new start. 
As she heals from her never-known disease , me.
