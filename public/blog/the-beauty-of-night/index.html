    <meta name="description" content="After the daytime colorful and bright,
The sun goes down and then comes night.
No light , no colors, lack of sight,
The only colors left are black and white.
Everything is dark and colors are gone,
The sky turns black in the absence of sun.
The moon and the stars rise in the sky,
What also rise are millions of &amp;quot;why ?&amp;quot;.
Every night I see those stars,
And wonder how many there are.
Yes, they are huge but they are far,
All I see is the past of the stars.
Some red , some blue and others are white,
Reds are far &amp;amp; blues are near says the light.
There&#x27;s one Moon but stars infinite,
All of these shows the beauty of night.

  The Beauty Of Night

<p>After the daytime colorful and bright,<br />
The sun goes down and then comes night.<br />
No light , no colors, lack of sight,<br />
The only colors left are black and white.</p>
<p>Everything is dark and colors are gone,<br />
The sky turns black in the absence of sun.<br />
The moon and the stars rise in the sky,<br />
What also rise are millions of &quot;why ?&quot;.</p>
<p>Every night I see those stars,<br />
And wonder how many there are.<br />
Yes, they are huge but they are far,<br />
All I see is the past of the stars.</p>
<p>Some red , some blue and others are white,<br />
Reds are far &amp; blues are near says the light.<br />
There's one Moon but stars infinite,<br />
All of these shows the beauty of night.</p>
