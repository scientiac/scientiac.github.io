    <meta name="description" content="Poems, the way I speak.
Eyes, they talk but weak.
Gestures, that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll give.
I&#x27;ve always been like this, so, believe.
Words, I just write them.
Fourth, like I always came.
Resist, all my feelings, then.
All those thoughts, in my brain.
Times, it has been many.
Rhymes, if I found any.
Chimes, my heartbeat makes.
Just three words, that&#x27;s all it takes.
Fine, like I always am.
Smile, I was programmed.
Clear, it&#x27;s like a diagram.
Life tests us, it&#x27;s an exam.
Shine, it&#x27;s my turn to.
Crime, would be to not do.
Perfect, though I seem blue.
I have to hide, with no clue.
Heart, it&#x27;s always been soft.
Sweet, like I have always loved.
Fighting, though, I&#x27;ve been idled.
Like life, this poem, everything&#x27;s untitled.
