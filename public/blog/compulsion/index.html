    <meta name="description" content="It&#x27;s fun for the first time, no joke is funny twice.
A mistake for the first time, crime if is done twice.
Sacrifice for the first time, all fine till it&#x27;s twice.
Say love for the first time, a lie if it&#x27;s said twice.
A chicken crossed the road, gets me each time.
Drugs would be erasers, if mistakes were crime.
A pencil gets sharper, sacrificing self each time.
Mothers fall in love twice, don&#x27;t agree? Ask mine.
It&#x27;s easier to hold on, more easy to let go.
It&#x27;s easier to move fast, more easy to take slow.
Decision, it&#x27;s easy but, it is easier to make no.
It&#x27;s easier to build it up, more easy is to blow.
A fire holds on with a spark, blow, and it won&#x27;t burn.
Take a punch! Move on? I&#x27;ll, take slaps but hold on.
Decide to run! It&#x27;s easier, stay and you might learn.
Respect that you build up, the best thing that you earn.
I can add more lines to this, make it seem it&#x27;s more.
Add more nonsense in it, make it seem it&#x27;s broad.
More stanzas are there, the more I feel I&#x27;ve scored.
What I&#x27;m feeling right now, is what this part stores.
Making rhymes it&#x27;s easy but, they are far from true.
What verses should I write, I don&#x27;t even have a clue.
Everything feels wrong, with just one point of view.
It&#x27;ll always be better with, a second point from you.
