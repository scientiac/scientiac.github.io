    <meta name="description" content="Why is this thing in my mind?
Is it what is keeping me alive.
I just can&#x27;t be afraid all my life.
It feels like I&#x27;m loosing the fight.
Why am I acting like I&#x27;m high?
It feels like I&#x27;m burning inside.
I have searched it far and wide.
Can anyone please show me light.
Are decisions getting hard to make?
This is what is keeping me awake.
Afraid that I&#x27;m never gonna make.
I keep failing the tests they take.
Am I really getting depressed?
Think I need some time to rest.
Despite of giving all my best.
I have always failed to impress.
Why am I even writing this poem?
Maybe to bury sorrow with rhyme.
Only thing that makes me whine,
That I just  have not a lot of time.
