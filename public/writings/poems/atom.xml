		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wish my wish never comes true,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and this life I was never born to,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
that the bang had never happened,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and I could see the true present.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish for God&#x27;s free will to play,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and I lost half my life each day,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
that I knew the unknown unknowns,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
could borrow the time, like a loan.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish I could move the immovable,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
want to be in the top of the world,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
wish I could travel back in time,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and for I could undo my crimes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could make everyone agree,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and could control what I see,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
control minds, mine and then others,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
visualize what all universe covers,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn a lesson with no failure,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
to every problem, there was a cure,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
wishes came true, when I want to,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
the night, bright and the day was blue.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish I knew each name and face,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
no knowledge left for me to chase,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
wish to move mountains with ease,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and make the impossibles a breeze.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To swim, in the depths of the sun,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and rewrite the laws that have begun,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
wish to be both here and there,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
to travel beyond without a care.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To know everything without learning,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and forget nothing without burning,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
but as I wish for things so grand,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I feel the weight of time and sand.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ll grasp at straws and hold onto hope,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
that someday, somehow, I&#x27;ll learn to cope,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
for wishes alone just cannot bring,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
the power to do impossible things.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Paths were taken, decisions were made.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Personality and values were given up.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Being different to being a different person.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Blended into same colors not existing anymore.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
What happened to doing things differently?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
What happened to not being influenced?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small possibility, it was enough.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Unique, new unknowns and histories explored.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Learning new things to learning it wrong.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Being morphed into what the past lamented.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
What became of not turning into them?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
What became of never letting oneself go?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lessons were learned, time was spent.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Tested were things and sure they were fun.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
From growing up to wishing of glowing up.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Becoming the mirror one never wanted to see.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
What happened to being the better one?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
What happened to no further breaking hearts?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lies were told, as they got out of sight.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Promises were broken as time passed by.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Being indistinct to gradually losing the links.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Forms altering from a somebody to no one.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
What remained of the one who did care?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
What remained of the person you strove to become?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s fun for the first time, no joke is funny twice.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A mistake for the first time, crime if is done twice.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Sacrifice for the first time, all fine till it&#x27;s twice.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Say love for the first time, a lie if it&#x27;s said twice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chicken crossed the road, gets me each time.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Drugs would be erasers, if mistakes were crime.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A pencil gets sharper, sacrificing self each time.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Mothers fall in love twice, don&#x27;t agree? Ask mine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s easier to hold on, more easy to let go.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It&#x27;s easier to move fast, more easy to take slow.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Decision, it&#x27;s easy but, it is easier to make no.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It&#x27;s easier to build it up, more easy is to blow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fire holds on with a spark, blow, and it won&#x27;t burn.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Take a punch! Move on? I&#x27;ll, take slaps but hold on.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Decide to run! It&#x27;s easier, stay and you might learn.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Respect that you build up, the best thing that you earn.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can add more lines to this, make it seem it&#x27;s more.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Add more nonsense in it, make it seem it&#x27;s broad.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
More stanzas are there, the more I feel I&#x27;ve scored.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
What I&#x27;m feeling right now, is what this part stores.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making rhymes it&#x27;s easy but, they are far from true.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
What verses should I write, I don&#x27;t even have a clue.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Everything feels wrong, with just one point of view.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It&#x27;ll always be better with, a second point from you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m too scared, and it is not my fault.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Choosing these words, became difficult.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minor details, I&#x27;ve begun to care for.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Never satisfied, wish I&#x27;d be there more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel disabled, to be there for you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Behind screens, pretending to care you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think about it a lot, before I say.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
All possibilities and the correct way.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thoughts, they conquer all my time.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Present, old past, new future of mine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right answers, I&#x27;ve been searching for.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
What I am searching is wrong, I fear.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say things, and think that I mean it.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
They just remain words, out of my limits.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future, possibilities of you and me.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
All gathers inside, into scary feelings.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My hands are frozen, and my heart shivers.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
My eyes are in pain, my brain just jitters.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;ve been scared, and I cannot feel a thing.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Am I awake? Cause this feels like a dream.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Those ordinary days, I just used to chill.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Endless possibilities, I&#x27;ve begun to feel.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
If this than that, the world revolves to it.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
One inevitable rule, that I tried to cheat.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The world&#x27;s broken, my head&#x27;s full of flaws.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
As I tried things, broken were those laws.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A step at a time, I&#x27;m losing all my grasp.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I trust people, keep falling for those traps.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A thousand times I think, to decide a blink.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Where else do I seek, just to find the link.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Should take on the hits, if you are in lead.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Let others leave, while you fight to bleed.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Why should I believe, anything you say.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Cause it&#x27;s every day, people come and play.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
But all hope isn&#x27;t lost, though it&#x27;s not the same.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It remains in the fire, as the heat to your flame.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Grow up with pain; cold, droughts and in rain.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
All the things you&#x27;ve seen, won&#x27;t just go in vain.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Some good it remains, in people that I know.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Daisies as they are, everywhere they&#x27;ll grow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s midnight!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only light is that of the moon,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
only light that I trust won&#x27;t go.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Only thoughts are that of yours,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
only thoughts that can not go.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Gone would be my sight all night,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
if the moon, was gone, forever.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gone would be my hope for life,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
if those thoughts, could disappear.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m awake all night when you&#x27;re there,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
because, you&#x27;re awake, night matters.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;m always there, the one for you,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
because, for me, it&#x27;s you that matters.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;d rather sleep waiting for you to call,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and dream about, our beautiful world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m your&#x27;s for eternity and a little more,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and I&#x27;ll be with you, forever entangled.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s almost one and the night&#x27;s darker,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and yet my eyes, are full of your smile.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Stormy sky and the lights are off now,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and yet my words, won&#x27;t stop for a while.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The more I write the less I know that,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
it&#x27;s not enough, I should write better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s never enough for me to write you,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;m writing you one and I&#x27;ll send it later.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

you&#x27;re different each day, like lua&#x27;s phases,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
the craters I see, are your subtle dimples,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
your shiny eyes, the moon glowing bright.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I compare you with the daisy in the wild,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
you smile for no reason, like daisies bloom,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
their dance with wind, is you being yourself,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
your simple heart, it&#x27;s what they represent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I compare you to the poems that I write,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
you&#x27;re the only one, like the rhymes I rhyme,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
worlds they contain, are your favorite places,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
your cute smile, is what they always seek.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I compare you with me and my nuances,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
you complete me, just like I want you to do,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
my weird views, are like &amp;quot;em&amp;quot; trends you follow,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
you yourself, is who I&#x27;m entangled with.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Then, flash bright, I dive, void deep.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Fine, my mind, it&#x27;s hard, to keep.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Cry, not loud, damp out, just weep.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poems, I write, with thoughts, so sad.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Life, I like, it&#x27;s not, that bad.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You, that&#x27;s right, the smile, you have.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Us, we met, that&#x27;s why, I&#x27;m glad.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dreams, sometimes, I see, you there.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Feels, my heart, it&#x27;s beats, unclear.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Smile, I do, when you, are near.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Glows, your eyes, it&#x27;s why, I care.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear, It&#x27;s gone, butterflies, all around.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Wish, came true, fly high, to clouds.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Leave, when you, my heart, it pounds.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Lean, on me, each other, we&#x27;ve found.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait! don&#x27;t leave, stay here, some more.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Talk, we will, till we, feel bore.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Shies, the stars, our smiles, before.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Seeing, you happy, I adore, amor.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things, you talk, sometimes, wordplay.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Trends, I learn&#x27;t, makes sense, now they.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Voice, my style, it&#x27;s modern, I&#x27;ll say.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Purr! my queen, go girl! you slayy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve seen those eyes a thousand times,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
flipping through your pictures, I sleep.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;ve been dreaming a lot about you lately,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
those dreams are more yours, than mine.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I hear your voice from the texts you send,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and I smile at you, from my phone.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;ve become us and the feeling&#x27;s stuck now,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
carved in our heart, that&#x27;s made of stone.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Us talking while we walk holding hands,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
it comes before me, I smile some more.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I trust you with all my deepest secrets,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
while we share stories, all night long.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The way you complete my midway stutters,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
with your words with mine, we talk.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You hear all my weirdest of interests,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and reply me, singing lyrics of songs.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Small chats and chit-talks that we do,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
binds me tighter, up with you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Stars shine and the moon glows bright,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
we call us names, and we talk all night.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;m up all night writing poems for you,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
with my heart, saying the words I feel.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
We are now entangled with a stranger force,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
it&#x27;s something, we don&#x27;t understand yet.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
When it started we had nothing to lose,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
but now to lose, it&#x27;s too late.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, my poems start with &amp;quot;sometimes&amp;quot;.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Those sometimes I cry.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Time, I do always write about it.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
No grasp, but I try.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Crimes, I think I&#x27;ll commit one once.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Fear shadows those thoughts.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Prays, though I feel like an atheist.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Please ignore it, gods.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Slaves, what I think we all become.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
To things, we think we want.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Poem, no, it&#x27;s just a disguised story.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
One of the many ones.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A story, with no end, or a beginning.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It&#x27;s of a different kind.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Stress, my only cause of disappointment.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And It&#x27;s a long line.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Love, I thought, could handle it well.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Foolish! I was wrong.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Reason, It&#x27;s not you or the system over us.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It was me all along.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Scared, I thought that I can&#x27;t ever be.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Cause you always were behind.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Empty, I always am, I need some more time.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
With no one but you as mine.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Story, I am trying to write about love.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Sadness is what occurred.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Fear, if not? What might be love, then?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Of breaking someone&#x27;s heart.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s time, I need to change.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;ll tell you the things I see till range.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see you as vacuum in a jar.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Of space that I love.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Much care and love to it.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You don&#x27;t get to sob.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surrounded by the forces.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Atmosphere, enemy of yours.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It&#x27;s me, yes! I am the jar.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I won&#x27;t break, pushes I endure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s no cure, once a hole.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Nothing will be the same, I&#x27;m sure.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Delicate and vulnerable, oh you!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A story for my emptiness, you&#x27;re pure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The voices in my head, they talk but are afraid,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I see the things in red, am I the only slayed,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
all my things they&#x27;re swayed, feelings say I&#x27;m dead,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;m lying on my bed, plans for dodging baits,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
the waves as sharp as blades, poisonous than lead,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
always there too late, laughters that were paid,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
the legends always said, people, they get played,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I hope that you stayed, it&#x27;s already been too late,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I keep making mistakes, not sure of other ways,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
my own mind has been jailed, everything I have failed,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
with everything left unsaid, slowly, these feelings fade,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
now as I lie awake, scared and scarred with no escape,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I think of how much it takes, to empty a heart so full of rage,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
voices, so very deranged, talking about the things that remain just as unexplained,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
freefalling into darkness, with hopes way too high up to mess,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
little by little the sadness trails, gets me ruthlessly betrayed,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
see the loudest smiles being staged, oh, I&#x27;d rather silently dread,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
the stories get just more mysterious by the day, with too much to hear and very less to ever say,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
maybe it&#x27;s all just a fake, this feeling I cannot quite shake,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
worse as the thoughts remained, misery almost always accompanied,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
maybe the voices in me are better dead, for my conscience to be by my side instead.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It symbolizes how two brains may say things in different ways but mean the same.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Did you think, the wait was over?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Oh! it&#x27;s has just began.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Your thoughts and dreams, and what not,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
it&#x27;s killing you from the &#x27;in&#x27;.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The more you wait, more will you think,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
it&#x27;s seems normal to me.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The more you think, less becomes you,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
as it&#x27;s supposed to be.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are a puppet, with some feelings,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
no brain that can see.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Just be a slave, approval you crave,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
it&#x27;s not your property.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Failure you are, more you seek,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
appeal from somebody.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Weakness all yours, it&#x27;s just one thing,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
irreplaceable monopoly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#x27;re just a dog, that needs a treat,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
you swing your tail around.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Give it a stop, once bark and bite,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
show, it is your surround.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You need to be, the one in charge,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
don&#x27;t shoot your foot here.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Describe your plans, redeem your spot,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and make them all clear.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you believe, the bad in you,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
sure it is coming through.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Resist the thought, and build it up,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
save it for what is true.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
All the times, the sleepless nights,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
they should remember you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Get your team, make good friends,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
you be the joining glue.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A circle needs, the center point,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
just until it is formed.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Then it gets lost, the void so deep,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
not coming back unharmed.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You should be best, compared to you,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
it&#x27;s only truth I know.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Resist the world, it&#x27;s filled with greed,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
you&#x27;ll reap what you sow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind your back, it&#x27;s just knives,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
not one is helping hand.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You look both ways, back, up and down,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
you&#x27;ll never know what will land.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Sometime you fall, just get up,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
you&#x27;ll need to sprint fast.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Before you speak, make a plan,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
or you will cry at last.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things will come, they go as well,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
even truths change with time.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Life gives you lemons, make lemonade&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
sell it and make your dime.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Keep trying things, make, hack and create,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
to try, it&#x27;s never too late.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
When you will shine, and build your fate,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
it&#x27;ll be worth the wait.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;synopsis&quot;&gt;Synopsis&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A room, a pen and a keyboard.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Poems, they&#x27;re just assumptions.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Today, I&#x27;m out from my comfort.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And I observed my surrounds.....&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a woman, talking with her dog.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It too jumped, and went for a hug.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Saw a man, a very huge load.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Dust, rough clothes, in a graveled road.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A girl riding her scooter, gliding through air.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Didn&#x27;t have a helmet, wind flowing her hair.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
In many people, common was a single thing.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Smiling they were, happy they seemed.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
My assumptions were wrong, I was blind.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Happiness was, just, a state of mind.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Though It may, It&#x27;s transferred from things.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Dog to the woman, way to the man.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And the scooter, that was her charm.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Something seemed off, a false positive.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
My data gave results, somewhat relative.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It&#x27;s what I saw, I here am the proof.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I saw a grandma, praying on her roof.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Seeing her face, there was a smile.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Why was she happy? I thought for a while.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
My data has shown, and it&#x27;s not wrong.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Hope was the key, the proof was strong.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It comes to me, times I used to hope.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Happy I was, no reason to sob.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Me, my questions, all starting from &amp;quot;how?&amp;quot;.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The realizations, they are, all I have now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Poems, the way I speak.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Eyes, they talk but weak.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Gestures, that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll give.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;ve always been like this, so, believe.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words, I just write them.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Fourth, like I always came.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Resist, all my feelings, then.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
All those thoughts, in my brain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Times, it has been many.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Rhymes, if I found any.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Chimes, my heartbeat makes.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Just three words, that&#x27;s all it takes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine, like I always am.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Smile, I was programmed.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Clear, it&#x27;s like a diagram.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Life tests us, it&#x27;s an exam.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shine, it&#x27;s my turn to.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Crime, would be to not do.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Perfect, though I seem blue.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I have to hide, with no clue.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heart, it&#x27;s always been soft.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Sweet, like I have always loved.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Fighting, though, I&#x27;ve been idled.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Like life, this poem, everything&#x27;s untitled.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What have I done for you?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Do I expect some things?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;ve always been there, your shadow.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Pushing limits, the poem sings.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do I feel not included?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Do you see me as a stranger?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;ve been there with you all the time.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Yet I&#x27;m alone, it&#x27;s all stranger danger.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing you, I think it&#x27;s love.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Things I&#x27;d do to make you smile.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And yet you&#x27;ve lost me here.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I see you found your style.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expectations, they are gone now.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I think, I am done here.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Ignoring you would be so great.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You don&#x27;t know what love is, dear.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve lost people this way.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
One person at a time.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Now I feel how my mom felt.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;ve been too kind, I&#x27;m fine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blind spots, though, you see things.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I was always in your side.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Some sides you don&#x27;t notice.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Though, you notice far and wide.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t care what you saw.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I always did my part there.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You should have seen me do it.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
My spectra were loud and clear.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I think why I did it.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Should not have pushed the bounds.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Now, every time it scares me.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Your eyes, the face, those sounds.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think I&#x27;ll stop what I did.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
But others deserve the same.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
So, I&#x27;ll behave the same way.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Until I finish crossing their name.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t feel missed by you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Because feelings can be false.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
But the proof doesn&#x27;t lie me.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You missed me, middle of the alls.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Every time, I wish those, feelings.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Many times, I wonder, emotions.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Make my life, heaven, hey Hell!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hope to win, their heart, their fake gods.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;ve been Lost in time, no space, my free soul.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Things I&#x27;ve done, till now, the good deeds.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Wishes my soul, in Dise, oh Hell please!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burning in the flames of fire, one, I feel.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The ice cold blistering curse, two, the itch.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Torture and pain to purify, three, my heart.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Being eaten alive, no mercy, a new birth!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think I&#x27;m going one hell, many choices.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
One where Christians go, is it, the Hell.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Or be it in the Hindus, they say, Narak.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
May be it&#x27;s them, Islam,  Jahannam!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choice and chances, I see it, the truth.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Feels like I&#x27;m in it, sometimes, my ruth.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m going, to one, I bet.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
All hail to it, null heart, true hell!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sins all those, I&#x27;ve done, to them.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Brings my soul, near you, to pure.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Chop me into, pieces, ream me.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Then you&#x27;ll see, the good, in me!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kills and flesh, the blood, torn wide.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Things I think, the ways, dark side.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Greed and jealousy, the thoughts, kill me.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Dear Hell, I only trust you, clean me!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jobs, some hope, all my needs.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;

Wars, the bars, the old scars.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limit, those bounds, what I could.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Focus, the sciences, my good mood.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;

Cold, my control, when we&#x27;re rude.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Wise, true advice, how we&#x27;re mould.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Truth, small talks, the way I was sold.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s a lot of things going on in my mind, right now.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Too many things I want to bring them out, but how?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Pain, mistakes, regrets, just aches that I have, oh wow!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Things I wish that I had stopped doing by now, no doubt.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every nice thing I try to do goes wrong, you know?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Break yourself along with the people you love, oh no!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I tend to win them back with some more truth, although!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
They wont ever know the darker side of me, just hope.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love others like the way you love yourself? please don&#x27;t!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Gave my whole heart away but she did&#x27;t want it. I wont.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Show them that you love them equal by heart? You can&#x27;t.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Know that you don&#x27;t have anyone to talk now, then rant.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tears from my eyes sliding down to the pillow, it&#x27;s wet.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I wish that I had pushed myself a bit harder, too late.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
One will stop loving me the way they do now, I&#x27;m afraid.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Not happy of what I keep on doing everyday, you bet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do it better than that I thought of? No way!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Say you have all the answers to my problems? Go away!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I don&#x27;t care what you think about my things, oh nay!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
So you went away and did it all your way? &amp;quot;hooh-rayh&amp;quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think about the past and think what&#x27;s new, do you?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Ghosts from the past haunting me everyday, aaah...phew!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I kept on cheating my way out from them, noone knew.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Keep looping back and repeat all my mistakes, not new.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need some people who say what I write are bad, I do.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I try to pour down everything on my writings, lies too.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Both my cheeks go red and the brain goes dark, heart blue.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It hurts to write and it hurts while writing, it&#x27;s true.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-poem-written-by-two-different-brains-with-different-emotions&quot;&gt;A poem written by two different brains with different emotions.&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incharge, I thought I was,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
thought I could control them.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Soo bad, was I soo wrong,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
couldn&#x27;t see when they came.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swiftly, they came by and got stuck,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
thought they&#x27;ll pass by and not stay.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Warm and subtle, they lured their way,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I fear I might be the one standing at bay.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shocked, I was to then know,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
how those began to then grow.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Scared, that&#x27;s all I was now,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
hide them? or, shall I show.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dilemma, you ask? that might not just justify,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
for I could decide but still not be bold.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Sunshines and storms, it slowly spoke sense.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Let it go or have faith and hold?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worried, I tend to cry sometimes,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
though my heart, warm it feels.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Defeated, from all these norms,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I bow to them and then I kneel.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longing, because it always feels home,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
but sometimes I wish I had a shield.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Quarrels and conquers, looking for win.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Somewhere, I know, I have to yield.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Those few moments before disasters,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Moments of breakups and pain,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Moments of failures and pain,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Moments of stress and pain,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Moments of rejections and pain,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Ahh pain!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
My one true friend, my love.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The one who never leaves me.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The one and the only!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I love the constant breaks and patches.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I love how you surprise me.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I love the things you do to me.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Yeah! Pain! I love you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I don&#x27;t remember the day I met you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
My first cry, probably was you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Pain, you make me happy.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The relief that it already happened.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The hope of mending the mistakes.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The feeling of being happy again.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Ohh pain!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
My one true friend, my love.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The one who loves me back.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It&#x27;s you who makes me strong.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It&#x27;s you who help me make decisions,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
strong, bold and difficult decisions.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Keeps me awake, help me breathe.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Without you, I may not exist.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
What&#x27;s &#x27;happiness&#x27; before you?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Like, that one girl, whom you like but....&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
That sweet cake, delicious but...&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
That engineering tag, with knowledge but....&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Those nice abs, with wows but...&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Happiness, you&#x27;re just full of buts,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&amp;quot;but toxic&amp;quot;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I just love the pureness of you, pain.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The night before a new day,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
or the day before that starry night.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It&#x27;s you who helps me though things.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
it&#x27;s you who showed me the world,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
to think differently, to live!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Oh pain!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
My one true friend, my love.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Everybody has experienced rejection.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Some are brutal, some meh! It&#x27;s fine.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I have experienced both, and yeah brutal.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
One is a personal rejection and the other...&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The other is weird, a chain rejection.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
But a chain rejection is weird and brutal.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A chain rejection occurs only in a group.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#x27;re presenting something in a group.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
An event occurs, which was&#x2F;n&#x27;t planned.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
One person supports the event and other,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and other and other and finally everyone.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
That moment, your presentation in crushed&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Crushed into pieces, pulverized, and finally&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
burnt to ashes, remains the dust, the dust,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
that&#x27;s of no use, a dust of pain and anger,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
In my case the it was dust of my first try,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
the dust of my confidence and finally,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
the dust of my creation, my happyness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weird right ?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, naming a phenomena is fun,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
sitting in silence swinging is fun too,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
writing a poem in pain and anger,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
too much fun!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The poem stores your anger in it,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And finally the poem heals you,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Ohhh! I had fun at last.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
What a great day!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Experiencing chain rejection, was fun.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I am welcomed, It was fun, Thank You!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

happy but scared.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I&#x27;m dreaming, yet awake,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
all because of you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way you look at me,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
your shining eyes.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
They are magnificent,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
see, I&#x27;m drowning into it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way you speak with me,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
your rosy pink lips.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Melts my heart into water,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
everytime, again and again.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My eyes search you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and find you in the dark.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The picture, it&#x27;s always yours,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
as my eyelids close to black.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can listen to my heart,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It&#x27;s dashes and dots.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Think it&#x27;s telling your name,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
In morse, &#x27;.-..  ---  ...-&#x27; and a &#x27;.&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope we have things in common,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and that, we could be one.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Hope, It&#x27;s a beautiful thing,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Butterflies, in my stomach.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing you happy, a heavenly feeling,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
your laugh, it mesmerizing.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Hearts, you&#x27;re supposed to rule.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Conclusion: You&#x27;re too beautiful.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tik, tik, tik&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It&#x27;s flowing! Or is it?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Multiple consequences, resulted from different decisions,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
to here, I started writing a poem.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Some say the flow is linear,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
but I like to assume it&#x27;s not.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I like to compare it to how Huygens described light.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The wavelets of time forming from each moment,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
different from others, multiple realities.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The branching is what makes it exciting,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
the assumption that my universe is different,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
it&#x27;s mine.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
What if I had not started writing this poem.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Would  there be another instance of this universe?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Where I am writing this exact poem?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
What is the other me writing?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Is he fantasizing time like I&#x27;m doing?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Or is &amp;quot;she&amp;quot; writing a poem for her crush?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Time is un-describable, it&#x27;s un-graspable.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
We are bound in time, a very, very short time.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Time makes us happy,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A short time with her.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It makes us sad,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A short time with her.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It makes us beg,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A short time with her.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Time, it&#x27;s a nasty thing.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Ah, wait! It&#x27;s 9:49 already?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Aww crap! I&#x27;m Late for college!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wonder what a blind man sees.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Does he see darkness like I do&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
or does he feel colors through his ears?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what a deaf woman hears.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Does she feel silence like I do&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
or does she enjoy music with her eyes?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what a dead person thinks.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Does it think of nothingness which I can&#x27;t&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
or does it think with it&#x27;s soul flying? Up! up in the sky.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m Unexperienced, I don&#x27;t know any.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Lost inside the wonders that my brain creates.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Is there a way to feel what others do? No!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s no good or bad in wondering.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The people dying in my head when they are late.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It&#x27;s just my own brain trying to scare itself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get overly excited wondering a thing.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A thing that&#x27;s close to impossible, soo close.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And then I am demolished by the same impossibility.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The positives and negatives of wonder.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
They are contained within themselves.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
All the difference is made by the truth I expect.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all the unreality breaks down in a while.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I snap back into existence, the real world.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Where the world is driven by it. Yes, wonders!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what I could be if ……………………&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Is it what is keeping me alive.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I just can&#x27;t be afraid all my life.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It feels like I&#x27;m loosing the fight.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am I acting like I&#x27;m high?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It feels like I&#x27;m burning inside.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I have searched it far and wide.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Can anyone please show me light.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are decisions getting hard to make?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
This is what is keeping me awake.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Afraid that I&#x27;m never gonna make.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I keep failing the tests they take.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I really getting depressed?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Think I need some time to rest.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Despite of giving all my best.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I have always failed to impress.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am I even writing this poem?&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Maybe to bury sorrow with rhyme.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Only thing that makes me whine,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
That I just  have not a lot of time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

And others I don&#x27;t want to fix.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Those mistakes I find myself.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And others, resonate from noise.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try doing things my way.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And others are forced on me.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Those things I understand.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And others, they go in vain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking questions I learn a lot.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Other things are (m.a)ed to try.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Now I play with: Force = m.a&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And others, I just know, don&#x27;t ask!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days I just listen, no talk.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Runners teaching toddlers to walk.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And I think they should let them fall.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Other times, I know that&#x27;s love.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Showing faults, is not what they like.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It&#x27;s kinda like training wheels on a bike.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I know generally medicines are bitter.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Don&#x27;t forget some poisons are sweeter.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Think I know how you do.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Tried to be there for you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Tried to be a friend in need.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Thought I could fix all this.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Thought we were bros still.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Don&#x27;t want to regret this time.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Need your help to fix my life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We...&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Got no time to talk&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Have no time to be there.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Need us both to understand.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Have all these things to share.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Need to win that wicked mood.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
But don&#x27;t need to win always.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Might as well fight sometimes.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Know that it takes some time.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Know that It has not been late.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Just need to communicate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;like&quot;&gt;Like,&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phone that I am &amp;quot;typing&amp;quot; this poem on...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language that I used to &amp;quot;express&amp;quot; on...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pillow where I am &amp;quot;joining the pieces&amp;quot; of this poem...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The polluted yet &amp;quot;facilitated&amp;quot; city where I am breathing the air from...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heck! I even managed to replace the &amp;quot;love&amp;quot; I used to have towards the girl I thought I loved...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;wait&quot;&gt;Wait!&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;even-though-they-are-replaced-they-never-leave-me&quot;&gt;Even though they are replaced, they never leave me.&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smell of the paper and the sensation of the pen gliding through it...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing in Nepali where I can express my feelings my way...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting on a cold chair with the warmth to write something from my heart...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My home village where I used to live though I am in the biggest city of my country...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing her face even though I feel like I dont love her anymore...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;but&quot;&gt;But,&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;there-are-things-beyond-my-understanding-of-replacement&quot;&gt;There are things beyond my understanding of replacement.&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My technical friend who came into existence before I did and became my elder with her un-understandable moods, behaviors, feelings...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only gods I believe in: my parents and their parents and their parents...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pain in my head which comes and goes away with the synapses trying to relate every minute thing to other , and trying to think about my own future...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unthinkable tension in my brain from thinking but not being able to think of what to do next but still knowing what I should really do...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unbearable truth of life that everything is going to end like I end this poe-tory though it has the potential to be much better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;yet&quot;&gt;Yet,&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;life-goes-on-and-it-is-irreplaceable&quot;&gt;Life goes on and it is irreplaceable.&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With the big bang&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Dust was formed.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Those combined&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Stars were born.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Some big some small,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
rocks were found.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
They revolved around&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and then turned round.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With passage of time&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
galaxies were formed.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
One of the galaxies,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
is our home,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
which contains a star&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
that we call sun.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was burning&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It was big.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A ball of fire&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
revolved around it.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
As the ball&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
started to cool&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Something called water&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
began to drool.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the water&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
life was formed.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
As life grew up,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
it used the sun.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Seeing the sun&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
up came plants.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
They were everywhere&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
on water , on land.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With plants on land&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
fishes came up&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Breathing under water&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
living on sand.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Then they left water,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
land was home.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
On the forests&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
they began to roam.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They grew up&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
with the trees.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Also started flying&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
like birds and bees.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Like the trees&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
they were huge.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
With their presence&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
earth would lose.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then one day.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
the sky was bright.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Big ones slept&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
the remaining were light.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Small creatures&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
began to hide&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
under the ground&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
without any light.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earth was cold&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
everything was freezing.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It was ice age&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
when they were living.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
As the ice&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
began to melt,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
All the creatures&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
relieved they felt.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trees were back&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
the sun was warm.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The birds started flying&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and bees with swarm.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The apes came up&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
and, then came men.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Men built houses&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Men made farms&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
That was how,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
we evolved.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All with time&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
we filled the earth.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
With cities and kingdoms&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Fights were fought.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
After all settled&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
we all were one,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
We made tech.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
we made phones.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Suddenly the earth&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
was small as stones.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that earth&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
They both were found.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Then they married&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
the oath was sworn.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
They were together,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
love was grown.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And that is how&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You were born.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Flying inside those galaxies,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
though far from my sight, I see it.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Like nebulae in the heaven, your eyes.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
There are times I am attracted to you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Pulled by the warmth inside you,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
though distant, I feel you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Like Chandra feels around Prithvi.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And...&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
There are times I fly free.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
In my own worlds, inside me,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
singing, dancing.... but,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I sense you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Like a hole in my own oblivion.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time can do a lot of things.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Walk you, build you, heal you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Break you, rape you, kill you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And yet you never died.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
From inside me, you resist.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
There are times without you,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
times when I feel free.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The greatest times of all time.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Those &amp;quot;sometimes&amp;quot; I enjoy.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
With people I do want to like.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Until you come ,&amp;quot;the big crunch!&amp;quot;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
end of time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Maybe, it&#x27;s not&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Maybe It&#x27;s only about me&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It&#x27;s about how I followed you&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
How I loved you&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
How we were together&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
How I felt when you disappeared&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Wait,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Maybe its all about you&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
About how you didn&#x27;t notice me&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
How you lived your life flying and playing&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
How you didn&#x27;t care&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
How you enjoyed the day and night&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
How I didn&#x27;t matter&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Or&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Maybe its about them&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
About how they made fun of us&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
How they made us different&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
How they manipulated our mind&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
How they used us both&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
How they took us apart&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Clearly&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
This was a heaven&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A heaven of hope&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Where you were a firefly&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
An innocent little beauty&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Where I was the night&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Dark cold and empty&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And they were the rain&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A cruel endless rain&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Because,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
We were destined to meet tomorrow.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A new day with a new hope&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Where I hoped to meet you&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
See you dancing&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
In your own small world&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
but all that&#x27;s left was hope&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Not just any hope&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
But a false hope&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A hope that broke my heart&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A hope which hid the pain of truth&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A hope that was toxic&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A hope which pushed me&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Far from your presence&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Far far away from you&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Far from the world of fireflies&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Far far away from my firefly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Sparkling droplets forming rainbow,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
dispersing light from white to colors.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The sound of yours give me different feelings;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
a feeling of satisfaction, relaxation.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A feeling that can put me to sleep.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You flow with a unpredictable turbulence,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
bouncing and breaking into droplets.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Droplets that go everywhere, anywhere.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Sometimes you drown me&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
maybe others too drown inside you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Never steady and ever changing,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;

I can&#x27;t be far from you&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
neither can I be near you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You are heavenly and beautiful as hell&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
or are you nature&#x27;s weapon of destruction.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It&#x27;s just in your nature to be anything,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
make your own paths and explore.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
New directions new ways&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
like the flow of  electrons of an atom.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&#x27;Uncertain!&#x27;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;

The sun goes down and then comes night.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
No light , no colors, lack of sight,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The only colors left are black and white.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is dark and colors are gone,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The sky turns black in the absence of sun.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The moon and the stars rise in the sky,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
What also rise are millions of &amp;quot;why ?&amp;quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every night I see those stars,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And wonder how many there are.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Yes, they are huge but they are far,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
All I see is the past of the stars.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some red , some blue and others are white,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Reds are far &amp;amp; blues are near says the light.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
There&#x27;s one Moon but stars infinite,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
All of these shows the beauty of night.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
