		<title>Life, Love, Twilight and a Butterfly</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve seen life in terms of science. Always tend to prefer science&#x27;s explanation better than any reasoning one might give to life. Because it makes sense. The relief of knowing the end. Believing in what might happen in the last moments. My preferred answers to all the things is scientific, that gives me the relief that it&#x27;ll be true most of the time. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet science fails sometimes. The tried, and tested methods might not be applicable, something that happens regularly doesn&#x27;t make it true. Consciously and subconsciously, I am still speaking of what science has proven. It has proven itself to be wrong most of the time. That, something should not be thought as one universal truth, but rather a possible truth for the current instance of time. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking outside the window, hearing the barking dogs, the sky is cloudy and it&#x27;s mildly raining. The streetlights are glowing everywhere, though it&#x27;s a moonless night, the world is still bright with life. The world around me is sleeping, it&#x27;s silent, I can hear each raindrop individually, the insects chirping, the wind and my heartbeat. A mosquito is flying around me, with its own goals, to get food, to get energy, to continue itself and preserve its kind. I have a different goal, to kill the mosquito and sleep well. Life&#x27;s keeping us both alive and awake in this night when everyone is sleeping and consciously dead. Everything is keeping me awake. Myself, the mosquito, the weather, the light outside my house, my phone and many unknown unknowns. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve read self-help books, I&#x27;ve watched a lot of talks about achievements and ideas and life, and I get inspired by it. But it doesn&#x27;t last long. Newton&#x27;s first law of motion said, &amp;quot;An object at rest tends to remain at rest, and a moving object tends to remain in motion in a straight line with constant speed.&amp;quot; Similarly, I tend to remain in the same state of what I am despite being motivated for some time. This whole analogy is faulty because scientifically an object in motion tends to remain in motion in a straight path, unless an external force acts on it. So, technically the reads and talks should have been impacting the whole trajectory of my life, and I surely can say that It hasn&#x27;t impacted enough to make a difference. The self-help books truly were written for self-help, their own self, like I am writing this piece right now for myself. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you&#x27;ll never know the correct answer. It&#x27;s fine to not know something, it&#x27;s fine to not know anything but, the realization that you will never know something is devastating. It&#x27;s the feeling of realization that you will never be able to get the thing you wished for. Life changes stories, one changes dreams, like science changes its truth over time. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some sleepless nights can get you what you want, others just take life away a tad faster. This one is the latter, the one that has no meaning, there&#x27;s no achievement, it&#x27;s just an unhealthy sleepless night. I need to sleep, I feel like sleeping, sleeping until a new day arrives, a whole new life waiting for me to sleep, so it can get to me even faster. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have explained life in different ways, how love fills it with joy, how having a friend makes it a lot easier to live, how some achievement may make you want to live a bit more. But I particularly like the way nature has taught us. If you cut the cocoon of a butterfly to let it come out of it easily, giving it love and all the care you could give, it will die, not being able to flap its wings, unable to take a flight, unable to live a life, unable to figure out things, unable to find a way to contribute to the world, unable to find a way to live longer and never getting the chance to bring more life like its own to the world. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loving an unborn butterfly is cruel, and loving a flying butterfly is stupid. One can only admire its beauty seeing it roam around the flowers, living dodging and ducking the predators and finding its own world to live, a life it wanted, not a life you wanted it to have, not a life you thought would be better, not a life with you and your unintentionally cruel love. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Who He Was</title>
		<published>2022-10-31T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2022-10-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://scientiac.space/blog/who-he-was/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://scientiac.space/blog/who-he-was/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;He had lived a life of a villagen; who was neither a villager nor a citizen. He was seen as a citizen by his village friends and a villager by his city friends. To his view he was a citizen as he lived in a town for studying and went to his village if there was a holiday of any sort.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because of that he knew the customs of the both worlds. The tradition and behaviours of village as well as the city had moulded him and his behaviours, as he wanted to be treated as native by both of his friend groups.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;village&quot;&gt;Village:&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a kid he would take goats for grazing, climb trees, run down the hill to the river, played with mud and sticks, football made up of clothes stuffed inside a sock, fly kites, slide in coconut leaves, made wheels by cutting slippers soles and run assuming they were cars or bikes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his teens he would still go to the village where his grandparents lived farming, ploughing and growing stuff. But he would not get a chance to experience how all those things were done. He&#x27;d sit as an outsider and watch them plough the field, controlling and turning bulls at their command and made them drag the plough on the filed. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They worried about him and his nice, clean clothes and would ask him to stay far from the field and not get dirty. He wore his dad&#x27;s old clothes and went to the field sometimes, but they still wouldn&#x27;t give him a chance to work, saying he&#x27;d get hurt.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;city&quot;&gt;City:&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While he was in the city, he&#x27;d play snake on his dad&#x27;s Nokia and watch cartoons like Ben 10, Pok√©mon, Bakugan, Dragon Ball Z, Tom and Jerry, Moo min, Zig and Sharko, etc on TV.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His dad got a smarter but still keypad phone (Nokia X1) which had internet, and he made his first Facebook account in it. He would download Java games like Assassin&#x27;s Creed, Spider-Man, Ben 10, Mario, Diamond Rush etc from Waptrick. When bored he would dig through the deepest settings of the phone and change things, which might have planted his love for computers at that time, and he still does it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#x27;d often go to his friend&#x27;s house and watch them play with their PSPs and Computers. He was always fascinated by how those things worked.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here his friends would not let him play with their PSPs and Computers as he didn&#x27;t know how to use them, and they were afraid if he would break it. As smartphones were at the market, his uncle gifted his mom with a Samsung Smartphone, and he played offline games like Temple Run, Mario, Plant vs Zombies, etc in it. The mobile data costs were high at that time and that has an effect on him till today; he doesn&#x27;t play online games.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;influence&quot;&gt;Influence&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He knew things of both village and town and even the teachers who taught them about primitive technologies and  other old things would be shocked by seeing him recognize everything they read from the book since he had seen them being used. He taught his friends to communicate secretly by the special language he learnt at the village (basically it was putting a special syllable before every syllable and speaking it that way. The special syllable was &amp;quot;cha&amp;quot; and the word &#x27;development&#x27; would be &amp;quot;cha-dev cha-lop cha-ment&amp;quot; but in our native language of course.)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#x27;d teach his village friends to make a Facebook account, upload posts, download games on their phones and all that &amp;quot;techy stuff&amp;quot; they thought was magic. He shared downloaded movies and music to them. He was a tech guy to everyone there. He still gets calls from his relatives if any kind of mobile related problems occur to them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is surely due to limited resources, He would use everything by pushing it to the limits. Still today, he digs through the settings of a newer looking phone, hoping he&#x27;d find new interesting stuff. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was never a native and that made him unique which he still enjoys being.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;today&quot;&gt;Today&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today he went to his village for a visit, and was devastated by the collapsing old house as it is abandoned and nobody cares for it. He got one day to recall all memories he spent as a child and also a teen. One day of sitting on the floor eating with hands in a smokey warm kitchen with food grown in the kitchen garden or rather &amp;quot;kitchen field&amp;quot; with no added chemicals. One day of eating fruits by picking it himself from the tree. One day of gazing at the stars shining brightly above the heaven below. One day of wishing to meet his old friends who mostly are now abroad for money. All those memories to come back melting the heart and eyes of who he was, me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;~ To Paru&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more I think about it, the more it becomes clear that you are the most loving and my favorite person. I remember those days in Bhirgaun and gulp thinking those days were too good and will not return back. I think about how we played hide and seek, made temples under the flower bush and get overwhelmed by the warmth it brings to my heart. I remember how we played;  you being teacher and I being a student  , you being my mother and I being your son , you being my wife and I being your husband. I remember sleeping on your lap while you played with my hair. I still remember you as that little girl who herself is scared but catches my hand to comfort me while I was scared of the imaginary ghosts from the stories told by Sudip. I remember coming to your house and staying the night talking to you when I didn&#x27;t get a phone to use WI-FI. I remember being compared to you as we were on same grade and I didn&#x27;t get top three position on exam while you stood first.I remember everytime I met you I kissed you on your cheeks and you wiped it. I remember you being angry and scolding me and the next minute we were talking about how we liked each other. I remember you skipping to another grade and actually being senior to me (You wouldn&#x27;t know how angry I was that day.). I remember you leaving Dharan and being far from me when we didn&#x27;t even had WIFI to communicate. I remember being lonely and sad when I went to your house and you weren&#x27;t there (I still do). &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since those Days we may be far from each other but I still love you the most . I still think about you and want you to call me, let me sleep on your lap and want you play with my hair while we share our stories , I want you to shout at me when I make mistakes and hit my stupid head while I irritate you with my weird interests. I am what I am because you were already in this world when I just came. Not every birthday can be special but some birthdays can. I want you to feel special  today because today is the day I love the most (even though I don&#x27;t remember the date). &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this capsule I make my most special person more special by making you the  first person in the world to get a birthday wish from this protocol. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With love,
~ Spu&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>The End</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am and will be yours and you are mine until the end. We are one single person, and will always be. Will never ever break apart. I vow to never leave you in your darkest times as well as mine. I will always be there with you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am I in this dark quiet place. Silence everywhere, why can&#x27;t I feel my heart beating ? Why the soil is not making any sound as I walk in it. Why is nobody here! Hello!! &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s been days, maybe weeks , why don&#x27;t I feel any hunger, thirst, not even tiredness. Am I alive or am I not? What&#x27;s that light over there ? Hello!!!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flash!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why can&#x27;t I touch you? Why do you look soo old? Why is that bulb glowing soo white instead of yellow? Is that a calendar? It&#x27;s been 10 years? Where are all the photos of mine? Is that your diary? What do you mean you waited? 
What is that mark on your neck? It looks like a healed cut. 
Hello???!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wasn&#x27;t a hallucination? So, am I actually dead? Why am I seeing her? And who&#x27;s that guy? Heyy!!, can anyone hear me!!? I&#x27;m up here! Wait, Are they kissing? How am I suddenly able to read minds? &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has gone through too much. She attempted suicide? Oh, that&#x27;s what the mark is. So, she met him two years ago on the same graveyard where I was buried.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He too knows what it feels to lose a loved one. His girlfriend died of brain tumor. Ohh so, he plays guitar too. Ahh those good old days.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, what have I become? What am I now? What is the purpose of my existence? Maybe there&#x27;s no reason at all.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I just a part of me that lives in her. Maybe this is my life after I am dead. I&#x27;m an infection inside her brain, the infection that has the ability to form into a tumor. I have the potential to kill her and maybe, maybe we can be together again, should I? But, what&#x27;s life then? Isn&#x27;t it the hope of being alive and trying to fulfill your dreams? What&#x27;s life without some pain, some wounds, some scratches and bruises that makes you feel more alive. She got the opportunity to live it the way it was intended, I didn&#x27;t. Yeah she is actually alive, the aliveness
that comes killing the pain, healing the wounds as the tears dry up. She&#x27;s alive, alive with new hope, with new feelings, a new start. 
As she heals from her never-known disease , me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>A Man Whose Heart Wasn&#x27;t Broken</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A wise old man once said and I quote,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She didn&#x27;t break my heart, she just made me very sad that my dopamine levels got very low. The only thing that could help to increase my dopamine and serotonin levels was to eat food. Excessive intake of so called &amp;quot;Tasty&amp;quot; food containing excess amount of saturated fat and cholesterol caused plaques to build up in my arteries.
Due to the buildup of plaque, my arteries started to narrow down, decreasing the blood flow to my heart. The reduced blood flow caused chest pain, shortness of breath and other problems. Days passed by, but the plaque gradually went on increasing. One day I woke up and found out that I was unconscious for 2 days. The plaque had completely blocked one of my arteries. I had a heart attack . She didn&#x27;t break my heart but she gave me a heart attack.&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was about to ask how the heck was he still alive, but my alarm went off and I woke up.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
