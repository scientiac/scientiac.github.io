Then it was when trying to make a website, I needed a server to continuously see the live changes that I did to my HTML file. I gradually learned about more industry standard servers like Apache after playing with the python server module almost all the time when testing and making a website. Then I found out about self-hosting. [That's what's like growing in a Linux environment.] I hated subscriptions and was unable to use the \"free\" VPS services due to their credit card requirements. Almost everything I did was entirely on my laptop and on my phone with Termux. [I used to use Termux even before I got a laptop.] Then, being in the Linux communities I got interested in Privacy and Security, then I joined mastodon as a healthier alternative social media platform as an experiment.\nI didn't know about decentralization and federation back then, I used the link from the YouTube channel I liked and that was my social media home, until that server (Instance) got shut down, and I had to move to a new instance, that is how I got to know about decentralization and federation. Now living in one of the servers, I found out about more services like mastodon that weren't mastodon but could communicate with my instance but had a completely different UI and features. I learned about single user instances and servers particularly for a single user. Since then, I wanted my own private island(instance) of my social media. I did somewhat treat this blogging site as my own island, but it is static and isn't like a \"social\" media at all. This is how I got interested in ActivityPub and wanted to build my own.\nIntroduction\n3o14 (pi) is a single user ActivityPub based social media that also supports rendering mathematical typesetting as a way to scientifically communicate between people. It is a self-hostable social media for a single person that is Privacy respecting (obviously) and we (It's not my single effort.) built it to understand the underlying protocol ActivityPub and how it worked. (And as a minor project for our computer engineering degree.)\nHow the Fediverse works\nThe Fediverse operates on a decentralized model, allowing various independent servers, or instances, to communicate with one another through open protocols like ActivityPub. Each instance hosts its own community and user base [It could be a single user too], enabling users to create accounts on different servers while still interacting seamlessly with users on other instances. When a user posts content, that activity is packaged in a standardized format and sent to other instances, allowing for real-time updates and interactions across the network. This federated approach ensures that no single entity controls the entire ecosystem, promoting user autonomy and privacy. Additionally, the use of open-source software means that anyone can set up their own instance, fostering a diverse range of platforms and experiences within the Fediverse. By leveraging these protocols, you can build applications that not only respect user privacy but also facilitate rich, interconnected social experiences across various platforms.\n\nWhat we wanted to build (and eventually built)\nWe wanted to build a single user social media platform using the protocol, that supported mathematical syntax for scientific communication. It had to be easy to deploy with minimal efforts and had to be federated with the network of Fediverse. It would be a platform for tech minded scientific people who want privacy in their social media and want to own their own data without having to rely on big tech and black box social media with constraints like Facebook, X, Instagram, etc. which do not have anything helpful for using mathematical symbols in the posts. [This absolutely doesn't mean that it doesn't support regular posts, it should.]\nI want to start from the frontend, because that is the most amount of work I have put in.\nFrontend\nFor the frontend, I used React Native because I was looking at the trends and saw a growing social media Bluesky writing its cross-platform frontend entirely in React Native and saw how they had all the features available in both their web and mobile platforms. It was fairly easy to use with a framework called 'Expo', which made building and testing the app in web and in android much easier. Learning about routes of expo and how it handled screens and modals was a bit difficult at first, but it got easier as the app grew. But working with multiple platform did bring multiple issues for different platforms.\n\nOne of the issues was rendering mathematics, there was no library that could render math on web as well as in mobile. I had to work around by using two libraries with separate rendering logic for web and mobile, of which I still am not satisfied with how the mobile renderer is a bit slow and janky, but I made the two platforms act as closest as possible.\nLearning about ActivityPub APIs was fun, I got to know how the requests were made and how things worked after the UI is clicked, how screens were loaded and so much. AI tools helped a lot to write logics and understand them when I was absolutely blank about what to do. [It happened more often than you'd think.]\nBackend\nI did not do much work on the backend, faultypointer did the work. But I do understand the technologies used in it. Hono was used for the server and fedify was used as the typescript library to eliminate the boilerplate for building Fediverse apps (I didn't just take that from the fedify site). The server too is written in typescript like the frontend. Fedify works as the middleware that processes the activity/json data that are requested to the server for federation. The database is Postgres and the schema and query is handled by the drizzle ORM.\nShowcase\n\n  \n  \n\n\nimg: homepage and replies page\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nimg: post compose and reply compose page in light mode with post visibility menu toggled\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nimg: homepage and profile page in mobile\n\nConclusion\nThere isn't much to conclude here because we have achieved the basics of what we want, but the work is very incomplete and alpha. We have an android app that does work with all other servers, not just ours thanks to Fediverse, but everything is bare-bones and need many improvements. This piece of art is presentable, but I now need to host both the webui and backend on a Raspberry Pi to show that a simple device can handle your social media, and you don't have to rely on big tech for it.\nLastly, here is the source for what we are working on, github/3o14-com.

The car is designed to detect fire using a flame IR sensor and go towards it to extinguish it if necessary. It also detects gas leaks and alerts the user via SMS. This report will detail the steps taken to design and build the car, as well as the challenges encountered and the solutions implemented.\nMaterials Used:\n\nArduino Uno\n3 Flame IR Sensors\nMQ-2 Gas Sensor\nMotor Driver\n2 DC Motor\nServo Motor\nWater Pump\nFire Extinguisher (tested with water)\nSIM800L GSM Module\nBreadboard and Jumper Wires\nPower Supply (Battery)\n\nDesign:\nThe first step in building the fire extinguishing and gas sensing car was to design a schematic. The car is powered by an Arduino Uno microcontroller, which controls the sensors, motors, and other components. The 3 flame IR sensors are used to detect fire from three different directions, and the MQ-2 gas sensor is used to detect gas leaks. The motor driver is used to control the DC and servo motors, which drive the car and the water pump, respectively. The fire extinguisher reservoir is mounted on top of the car and the pump pushes the extinguisher from the pipe which is spread by the back-and-forth motion of the servo motor. The SIM800L GSM module is used to send SMS alerts to the user in case of a gas leak.\nConstruction:\nOnce the schematic was finalized, the next step was to build the car. The components were connected to the Arduino Uno using a breadboard and jumper wires. The flame IR sensors were mounted on the front of the car on in the front and two facing either sides, and the MQ-2 gas sensor was mounted on top. The DC motors were connected to the motor driver and were used to drive the car. The servo motor was connected to the L298N motor driver and was connected to the fire extinguisher. The water pump was connected to the Arduino Uno and was used to pump water from the reservoir to the fire extinguisher which moved in a to and fro motion to spread the water coming out of it.\nTesting:\nOnce the car was built, it was time to test it. The car was placed in a test environment and was subjected to various scenarios. The flame IR sensor was able to detect fire and direct the car towards it. The MQ-2 gas sensor was able to detect gas leaks and activate the SMS alert system. The fire extinguisher was successfully activated by the servo motor, and the water pump was able to pump water to the fire extinguisher.\nChallenges and Solutions:\nOne of the major challenges encountered during the construction of the car was the calibration of the flame IR sensor. The sensor needed to be calibrated to detect the flame accurately and direct the car towards it. The heater connected to our room was also detected as a fire source which made it harder to test the bot. This was solved by testing the sensor with different fire sources and adjusting the code accordingly. Our test subject for demonstration was a burning paper which was used for the calibration of flame sensor.\nAnother challenge was the activation of the fire extinguisher. The servo motor had to be calibrated to activate the extinguisher at the right time, and the water pump had to pump the water at the right pressure. This was solved by adjusting the code and the components until the system worked correctly.\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, the fire extinguishing and gas sensing car using Arduino is a useful device that can prevent fires and detect gas leaks. The car is powered by an Arduino Uno microcontroller and uses sensors, motors, and other components to perform its functions. The car was designed and built with the help of a schematic, and was tested successfully. The challenges encountered during the construction were solved by adjusting the code and the components. The car can be further improved by adding more sensors and refining the code as the SMS functionality was still flaky.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/arduino-firefly/","title":"Project Firefly"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/bad/":{"body":"Deeds of blood that villains pump keep all books alive.\nNever are things, clear they seem, looking through the eyes.\nWhen I see a problem solved, rule books see me wrong.\nAmidst the people, ones who get me, is where I belong.\nWhat I have, an evil twin, deep beneath my heart,\nTakes control, shreds you apart; dare not push too hard.\nYour world is the same as mine; thorns where roses grow.\nBlack and white of your grays is what I try to show.\nNeither good nor am I bad; it's just what you see.\nCan't I show, and you didn’t see, what I deemed to be.\nI'll try to die and die happy, teaching how not to go.\nI'm sorry I failed to be what the world wanted me to show.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/bad/","title":"\"Bad\""},"https://scientiac.space/blog/boot-arch-smoothly/":{"body":"My Device\n\nFirstly...\nMy friend challenged me to achieve flicker free boot on my laptop like someone achieved it many-many years ago, and said if fedora can do it by default why can't we?\n\n\nTechnically he didn't challenge me, he only mentioned that it was possible. And, I took it as a challenge. Because I know that linux can be as smooth and polished looking as\nother commercial OS offerings. And I want my laptop to be as smooth as possible and as clean looking as possible.\nSo, I tried.\nHow did you start?\nThe only thing I didn't really want to do was reinstall my OS again. But, I had to.\nI had never used the Unified Kernel Image (UKI) and I was using systemd-boot as my bootloader.\nSo, the bootloader had to go and UKI had to be installed.\n\n\tNote\n\t1. When installing Arch Linux, use UKI Unified Kernel Image and instead of using a bootloader, use EFIstub (EFI Boot Stub)\n\n\nI used archinstall and it had both of these options. It was very easy. I picked all other configurations as I used to do and just installed the system.\nAfter Installation\nI had to change the kernel parameters, to make all those text go away. So, I tried using efibootmgr and failed again and again.\nI couldn't for science's sake use it properly. Once, I tried using the script recommended by the arch-wiki, the boot process flickered more than It had ever flickered.\nLuckily it hadn't removed the original entry and efibootmgr had a way to remove the broken entries, so I brought everything back to normal and tried it a countless times, failing each time.\nI gave up on efibootmgr, from previous experiences with booting with a splash screen, I knew plymouth was a thing. So, I installed it. And went searching for ways to put kernel-parameters during boot. Plymouth needed quiet splash to work.\nThen, I found /etc/kernel/cmdline. I added quiet splash to the end of the line and then rebooted. It showed no changes.\nI found out that I had to rebuild the initial ramdisk environment. In other words I had to run:\n\n\n\tNote\n\t2. To add kernel parameters, you need to append the text on /etc/kernel/cmdline and then, rebuild the initramfs image using sudo mkinitcpio -P.\n\n\nMy /etc/kernel/cmdline looks like this:\n\nThe part until rootfstyps=btrfs was autogenerated during installation and I added the rest afterwards.\nNow, It Worked! But, it was the same(somewhat). The splash animation for ASUS ran, then it showed me a big Arch Linux logo, then the screen went black and then the splash screen reappeared and it dropped me to my login manager. This was the behavior it used to show before I installed arch without doing anything I previously did. Basically, I was back to how it was before I reinstalled my OS. All that copying and configuring for nothing.\nWhy you should not give up\nSo, I started putting different kernel params to check if one of it worked and if any of it removed blackout before showing me the splash screen again. The wiki for silent boot suggested I put loglevel=3 systemd.show_status=auto rd.udev.log_level=3 in the kernel parameters.\nIt also said:\n\nIf you also want to stop systemd from printing its version number when booting, you should also append udev.log_level=3 to your kernel parameters. If systemd is used in an initramfs, append rd.udev.log_level=3 instead.\n\nSince, I wasn't using systemd in the initramfs, I used udev.log_level=3 instead. Then I rebuilt the initramfs and rebooted. It was the same.\n\n\tNote\n\t3. Append quiet loglevel=3 udev.log-priority=3 systemd.show_status=false splash in /etc/kernel/cmdline to enable splash and quiet out the logs.\n\n\nThen I became desperate and started looking everywhere; forums, wikis, even YouTube comment section. And, you know what? YouTube comments helped for once.\n\nThis comment is from the YouTube video I have linked above.\nI finally realised, plymouth was the culprit. The kernel had to hand over the process to plymouth and it caused the delay after the big Arch Linux logo.\nI also found out that kernel itself can render the logo without plymouth, that was how the Arch Linux Logo was being rendered even before plymouth had started.\nIf only, I had read the silent boot wiki entry properly:\n\nTo prevent the kernel from blanking the vendor logo, Linux 4.19 introduced a new configuration option FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE_DEFERRED_TAKEOVER that retains the contents of the framebuffer until text needs to be printed on the framebuffer console. Since version 4.19.arch1, the official Arch Linux kernels are compiled with CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE_DEFERRED_TAKEOVER=y.\n\nThanks to arch I didn't have to recompile the kernel to get that.\n\n\tTip\n\tThere is no need to use plymouth because the Linux kernel can show splash images by itself and enabling both only makes the process less smoother.\n\n\nIt still wasn't \"smooth\"\nI didn't want the Arch Linux logo, I wanted my vendor logo to be continued, like it was still booting until my login screen appeared.\nIf only I can replace the \"Arch Linux\" logo with bgrt (The vendor's splash logo). So, I went looking where I could change that.\n\nThe Boot Graphics Record Table (BGRT) is an optional ACPI table which contains a pointer to the image that has been drawn during boot.\n\nI found /etc/mkinitcpio.d/linux.preset to be the exact thing I was looking for. And from the name itself I knew I needed to rebuild the initramfs again for the changes to be reflected.\nI had to change the following line in linux.preset:\n\nMy first instinct was to go to /usr/share/systemd/bootctl/ and rm splash-arch.bmp. I did that and rebooted, Now, It showed black screen until the login manager showed up.\nIt was progress.\nThen I found my bgrt image in /sys/firmware/acpi/bgrt/ it was named image with no file extension.\nSo, I changed the above line to:\n\nThen I rebuilt the initramfs and rebooted. To be greeted with a smooth boot. Like I wanted it to be. Showing bgrt until the login manager showed up.\n\n\tNote\n\t4. Change the default_options= configuration to /sys/firmware/acpi/bgrt/image in /etc/mkinitcpio.d/linux.preset then rebuild the initramfs by doing sudo mkinitcpio -P.\n\n\nIt was not as \"smooth\" as plymouth\nThe booting process was good and how I wanted it to be, but when it came to rebooting it showed:\n\nI didn't want that to show up and with a bit of research, I came to a conclusion that disabling watchdog was fine so I did. I edited /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf and added blacklist sp5100_tco. Intel users are supposed to blacklist iTCO_wdt or the watchdog that their system used.\nNow my /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf has:\n\n\n\tNote\n\t5. Blacklist your watchdog so you don't get watchdog messages when rebooting and powering off by editing /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf.\n\n\nI don't like having nice things\nWhat I did above is enough to get flicker free boot/smooth boot or whatever you call it, but I wanted more, I want plymouth to work without flicker. Spoiler: I couldn't.\nAnyway, I switched to systemd instead of udev so my /etc/mkinitcpio.conf has the following hooks now:\n\nI reinstalled plymouth, and I like it when it smoothly transitions to GDM instead of flashing me to GDM. It was a tradeoff between GDM flash or just flicker when loading spalash screen.\nI added more kernel parameters to mitigate the flashing but I couldn't do it.\n\nplymouth.use-simpledrm does start plymouth immediately but when the amdgpu driver is ready it mode-switches to it and the black screen appears. I can technically use nomodeset and achieve true flicker free boot with plymouth and everything but then I lose out on my graphics driver setting dpi scaling and brightness and more for me on boot.\nI even tried setting /etc/plymouth/plymouthd.conf to delay it's starting but it still doesn't stop flickering. It either flickers or it skips and I get the UKI splash screen until the login manager.\n\nI think I will just remove the plymouth configuration since it isn't helping anything. Or maybe I'll just leave it there because it is not doing anything.\nRemoving Arch Linux Logo\nTo remove the logo from GDM I quickly installed gdm-settings and there was a toggle which I turned off.\nI didn't like the logo shown by plymouth during boot either, so I just removed the image watermark.png from the spinner theme in /usr/share/plymouth/themes/spinner/. I also removed all animation and throbber images just to make everything clean.\nConclusion\nI did eventually come back to \"not so smooth boot\" but I am one sudo pacman -R plymouth away from it. Furthermore, I can boast about having 3 splash screens that look the same transitioning seamlessly*, even 4 if you count the UEFI animation.\nIt goes as follows:\n\nUEFI animation starts and ends.\nUKI Splash Screen starts and ends.\nsimpledrm backed plymouth bgrt theme starts and screen goes blank.\namdgpu backed plymouth screen gradually appears and transitions to GDM.\n\nBut, if I remove plymouth:\n\nUEFI animation starts and ends.\nUKI Splash Screen starts and drops me to GDM.\n\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/boot-arch-smoothly/","title":"Booting Arch Linux Smoothly"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/bricks/":{"body":"The scariest moment when flashing custom ROMs(for amateurs).\nIf someone told me to root a phone five years since now, I would get scared of damaging the device. I didn't have internet at that time and also a very little knowledge of what it could do. I just knew that it could let me see the passwords of connected WIFI as well as the passwords of WPS enabled WiFi which at that time was like a treasure to me. A friend of mine had rooted his phone and he shared his experience that his phone was completely dead a few days after while adding a module. He shared stories of phones blasting and catching fire because of root and since I didn't have internet there was nothing to do except to believe in his stories. Those stories caused me to think that I would never root my device ever.\nBut after some years we had internet in our own house and I used to watch life hacks, hacking videos, new gadgets and inventions, new and useful apps for android, phone reviews, customizing android, and all sorts of tech videos on YouTube. On some hacking videos (hacking with an android, I didn't have a computer at that time.) I again stumbled upon root. Then I watched videos describing benefits and disadvantages of rooting. I loved to watch what a phone could do with Magisk modules and was very eager to try rooting. But still deep inside my brain there was a feeling that I would damage my new phone.\nAfter a lot of watching advantage and disadvantage videos I decided to root my phone, I knew that it would void the warranty of my phone but after four months of buying I was so eager that I unlocked the bootloader (MI made me wait 7 days) flashed a custom recovery and rooted my phone. I installed a bunch of modules with Magisk and Ed-exposed, tweaked MIUI with substratum which did cause my first boot loop, but it was easily fixed because there was a zip pre-managed by substratum for those cases.\nA few days after I rooted, there was an update to MIUI and I decided to install it like I normally did. My phone wouldn't boot to the system, It just rebooted after the MI logo. I was having chills in my heart, suddenly I felt very cold, I booted to recovery and tried to format my device. It didn't solve the issue, but all the files on my device were deleted. I started searching for fixes, I flashed the official MIUI ROM by forwarding it via adb, but the Issue was still there. I tried flashing pixel experience, Havoc, Corvus etc. but nothing worked. It was 12 AM already, and I still was trying to fix my phone. Then I found out that there is a different kind of ROM that could be flashed from fast boot mode, first I tried the latest fast boot ROM, and it still didn't work, then I tried the oldest fast boot ROM, It changed the boot screen to old MI logo but was still stuck on a boot loop. At that point I was crying, I had bricked my phone, The warranty period hadn't finished, but my warranty was already void. I slept at around 2 AM with a cold heart and tears in my eyes.\nThe next morning I woke up at 5 AM, at that point I was ready to do anything to fix my phone. I tried a bunch of things from the internet but none of them worked, then I came across a tool called \"ALL in One\" on XDA forums dating back to 2014 (This story takes place in 2020). I immediately downloaded the tool, installed the exe file, and opened the program. There was an option to flash recovery ROMs, I downloaded the latest official recovery ROM, connected the phone to my computer and flashed it using the tool. And magically it worked, a tool from 2014 saved my phone. But that incident didn't stop me from rooting my phone because as soon as the phone booted I went back to the recovery mode and flashed the magisk file.\nAfter some weeks I flashed a custom ROM from the same tool and fell in love with it. I tried different ROMs after that and yes I did go into a boot loop sometimes, but I could easily fix it. Now, it isn't a big deal to me to flash a ROM or root anyone's phone and I love doing it.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/bricks/","title":"My Experience with Bricks and Bootloops"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/chain-rejection/":{"body":"Everybody has experienced rejection.\nSome are brutal, some meh!

You yourself can modify it as per your liking if you know what you are doing. Custom ROMs are the product of the openness of  Android. If you have noticed, when you use a Samsung phone it feels different than a phone from Xaomi which is also one of the blessings of an open software.\nCustom ROMs are the modified versions of the original Android operating system that can be installed in place of the Stock ROMs ( The OS that's already present on your device when you bought it. ) . Custom ROMs can be very beneficial if your phone supports it.\nAdvantages\nLatest and Greatest\nIf your manufacturer stopped sending software updates for your phone then you can get the latest version of android if you install a custom ROMs on it. And since it will be how android was originally made you won't get bloatware and ads on your system apps that you normally see on generally every Stock ROM.\nVersatility\nThere are many Custom ROMs that you can choose from. Each of them are unique in  their own ways. They differ from features, battery life, performance, etc.\nPrivacy and Security\nMost Custom ROMs have Google services scraped out from them, that alone is the biggest feature for a privacy-centric device. They come preinstalled with open source alternatives of the propitiatory apps that can get your job done. Some ROMs even give their own services for cloud storage, emails etc. making them more privacy focused. You generally get the fastest security updates making your phone less vulnerable to malwares and bugs.\nCustom Kernel\nDifferent ROMs use different kernels ( The part of an operating that is directly connected to the hardware and is responsible for controlling it ). Kernel is heavily responsible for the experience you get from your device.\nImproved Performance\nMany Custom ROMs offer you improved performance - definitely better than the Stock ROM that your manufacturer offers you. It is due to the fact that all the bloat are removed , latest version of android is present and the processor is overclocked.\nImproved Battery Life\nSince all the bloat and ads are removed the background processes on your device gets substantially reduced that adds up extra life to your device. And you can even under-clock your processor that helps a lot to gain more battery life.\nCustomization and Uniqueness\nDepending upon the Custom ROMs you get different levels of customization as well as you get a unique looking UI which you cannot get on any Stock ROM. You can entirely hide the icons on status bar, change the boot animation, apply system wide themes, the possibilities are endless.\nDisadvantages\nWidewine L1\nYour ROM might not have widewine L1 support making you unable to view HD content on  applications like Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc. You will have to root and do the modifications or wait for a software update that enables it.\nSafetyNet\nYour ROM may fail to verify SafetyNet, not being able to install certain apps especially banking apps if you use them frequently. This also can be fixed by rooting and doing the modifications.\nOnly For Snapdragon and Exynos Processors\nMediaTek in terms of Source Code has a policy, of not distributing it for free just to anyone unlike Snapdragon and Exynos processors. So there cannot be Custom ROMs designed for MediaTek unless they clarify themselves as opensource, or someone buys the source code from them and gives it to the developers.\nCamera With Less Software Optimization\nGenerally the camera apps of Custom ROMs are poor in terms of software optimizations and versatility. This issue can be fixed by installing Gcam ( Which might even have better software optimization than your Custom ROM offered. ). You also have the ability to install ANX Camera ( MIUI Camera for Xaomi Devices ) but it require you to flash files from a custom recovery or via Magisk after rooting.\nRoot Access\nSome Custom ROMs require you to have root access to work that can add a big vulnerability to your device since it opens up your system directories that might cause all your data to be leaked if a malicious app got access to it. This can be prevented by your efforts of not letting any malicious apps to get into your device and access root level permissions.\nNote :-\nInstalling a Custom ROM require you to to unlock your device's boot-loader. The method and process of unlocking the boot-loader completely depends upon the manufacturer ( Some doesn't even give you the ability to do so. ). You might also need to install a custom recovery for the installation. If not done with proper care and knowledge you might brick your device during the process.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/custom-rom/","title":"Custom ROMs"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/daisy/":{"body":"My hands are frozen, and my heart shivers.\nMy eyes are in pain, my brain just jitters.\nI've been scared, and I cannot feel a thing.\nAm I awake?

Instead of embracing the difference we have; color, religions, cultures, gender, shape, richness, etc and a different set of brains which can think differently we tend to fight against each other thinking we are not the same.\nI stopped writing this article four days ago and I am trying to give this a proper ending. But the way my Brain processed these things is different than it was four days ago. I am unable to think further. The thing that I realize from this is that not even my own brain thinks the same every time. The same article will be different If I wrote it in a single day than if I wrote it one paragraph each day.\nWe humans don't want to change from who we are. We don't want others to teach us what is right or wrong but we do want to teach others. We feel happy on finding mistake of others. Not everyone will realize this anytime soon and the world is not going to be a better place in the near future. It's like the adoption of Linux as an operating system. There is not going to be a mass adoption of Linux anytime soon even though It is the best operating system which is privacy respecting, easy to use heck even 'ecofriendly'.\nNot everything that is good is praised and adopted by everyone. It is mainly because they don't understand it or because they are so used to their own thing that they don't consider that change is a good thing. Nobody can convince anyone to adopt something they like if the person have no understanding of what it is (The case is even severe than that if that person has false information about it). The thing is that, people get scared of the things they don't understand.\nThis article is not going to change anyone's mind if someone disagrees with what I have written but will definitely bring a smile to the faces of the ones who did agree with what I am saying even before I even wrote it. Because that's how a human brain works.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/dark/","title":"Dark (Realization)"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/de/":{"body":"Linux : You want it, you get it.\nA desktop environment is a set of programs running on the top of an operating system which share a common graphical user interface. It is also known as graphical shell. It determines the user experience, look and feel, customisability, usability and many others aspects of a graphical experience. It is abbreviated as DE. A desktop environment can determine the whole user experience of a operating system.\nEvery operating system has a desktop environment but Linux is the one with multiple swappable desktop environment. Since Linux is very modular  you can swap almost anything from it which also includes the DE.\nWindows and OS X doesn't give you the ability to change DEs so there is  not much to talk about them. But we have a lot of DEs in Linux, some of the popular ones are :\nKDE\nKDE is one of the most famous and customizable DEs. It also is my favourite DE. KDE is considered as the most customizable DE of all. You can customize   most of the parts of your DE from the system settings and additionally you can add modules and third party applications to customize KDE even more. It is very lightweight and easy to use out of the box. It itself is \"the beauty and the beast\".\nGnome\nGnome is also one of the most used and popular desktop environments. It is very very beautiful out of the box. It is fairly customizable and easy to use.   Gnome is very good for normal people because you don't really need to customize it to get a smooth and beautiful desktop experience.\nXFCE\nXFCE is termed as a light  desktop environment with very low ram consumption and a fairly customizable desktop environment. It is the most suitable DE for old computers with weak hardwares. Basically, it is  fast and low on system resources, while still being visually appealing and user friendly.\nThe list of DEs will go on and on but some other DE are as follows :\n\nMATE\nLXQt\nDeepin\nCinnamon\nPantheon\nCosmic\nUnity\nCutefish\nMoksha\nLXDE, etc\n\nNormally DEs Offer :\n\nA set of standard APIs, a programming environment, and guidelines.\nSet of languages to choose from.\nSettings to configure whatever you want.\nA suite of essential applications including a camera app, a file manager, a terminal emulator, an image viewer, music and video player, office suite, etc.\nA display manager which determines the look and feel of the  login screen.\n\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/de/","title":"Desktop Environments"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/dear-hell/":{"body":"All the times, I smile, the thoughts.\nEvery time, I wish those, feelings.\nMany times, I wonder, emotions.\nMake my life, heaven, hey Hell!\nThe hope to win, their heart, their fake gods.\nI've been Lost in time, no space, my free soul.\nThings I've done, till now, the good deeds.\nWishes my soul, in Dise, oh Hell please!\nBurning in the flames of fire, one, I feel.\nThe ice cold blistering curse, two, the itch.\nTorture and pain to purify, three, my heart.\nBeing eaten alive, no mercy, a new birth!\nThink I'm going one hell, many choices.\nOne where Christians go, is it, the Hell.\nOr be it in the Hindus, they say, Narak.\nMay be it's them, Islam,  Jahannam!\nChoice and chances, I see it, the truth.\nFeels like I'm in it, sometimes, my ruth.\nI'm sure I'm going, to one, I bet.\nAll hail to it, null heart, true hell!\nSins all those, I've done, to them.\nBrings my soul, near you, to pure.\nChop me into, pieces, ream me.\nThen you'll see, the good, in me!\nKills and flesh, the blood, torn wide.\nThings I think, the ways, dark side.\nGreed and jealousy, the thoughts, kill me.\nDear Hell, I only trust you, clean me!\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/dear-hell/","title":"Dear Hell"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/death-of-a-view/":{"body":"The roses that aren't being picked, are making my path more beautiful today. Yet the so called (relation, situation, partner, companion)ship which once was a thing, is now a parasocial one for me. I never in my life thought that I would give up on some(thing, one), but here I am with a knife in my hand, which I might have used for picking roses before is now being used to plant them.\nPerception, a view of the world, their world, from their eyes. But all eyes have their weakness, their truth, their belief, their arrogance for what the world is. But sometimes the tears wash them away, new worlds are born, new views, new ideas, a completely new picture forming right behind(before?) their eyes. Though what it is remained unchanged, what there is, is something different from what there was.\nThere was a time when I justified that the flowers were meant to be picked, and they were meant for me to be picked. The ones without life in them were more precious, more meaningful. Values change, dead flowers are nothing but litter, nothing more than a wrapper to a well thought present(as in time), made to be torn(thrown) away.\nThe simplest of the sentences can feel cryptic, with hidden messages. But the ones I write neither make sense without the message nor only the message itself. These aren't stories that I write, these are the realities that I relive each day differently, from different perspectives and see from eyes of different people. This could mean a lot of things and at the same time nothing.\nWe humans crave being seen, being noticed, being understood and none of us think that what we are, are wrong, are bad. We don't think negatively of ourselves, and we don't want others thinking negatively about us. But, fear, that evolved to save us from danger, is now hurting ourselves. Not saying anything, not having views, is far easier than having a negative version of you in someone's mind because of your views. This is hurting us all, this is why we don't talk, we run away from being a part of the drama but at the same time we love to be the audience, and we love to feel it (to be the protagonists in the drama), in other words we love to be the winners in the drama despite having a view or an opinion of who was correct.\nI don't like how we are moving ahead with fear. To be incorrect, to not always be the main character, to let our experiences be judged no matter the outcome, to get framed (both in good and in a bad way) or to be loved (both in good and in a bad way) is just how we know things, it's the way life works, it's the way tears fall, it is the way perspectives change.\nBelieving in something is different from believing in what you are and what you can do. Truths change, but beliefs remain. If you believe in the ability of yourself to do something, it should not be able to be changed by someone's perspective of you, but beliefs toward something should be moldable.\nWhy am I saying all this? It is because I have gone through perspective shifts and they are painful. One day, you will believe something that you wish you didn't believe in, you'll cry(or die, to be born again). That day these texts will mean something to you if it doesn't now. And that day you'll know that the thing that you were waiting for was just a wish to a falling star, just a false, hopeful, belief and the only thing you will want is for things to get better, though now it won't have any effect on you because those dead roses will have crumbled away and the roses you planted will already have died.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/death-of-a-view/","title":"Death of a View"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/destination-linux/":{"body":"Butterfly effect of my encounter with KDE.\nI first came across linux a couple years ago [In 2017] when I was surfing the internet about customizing the windows desktop, and I saw a video about customizing the KDE Desktop. I clicked on that video and realized that the thing he was using wasn't windows but something else. I quickly searched about KDE and I found Linux. At that time I didn't have my own personal computer that I could modify, not even windows. I was just curious if it was possible to customize computers as I used to customize my smartphone a lot.\nLinux isn't something that you understand with a random video especially if the video contains words like 'distro', 'desktop environment',etc. So, I started searching about those things. And as I learnt new things about linux new terms and words kept comming up and I searched about them and got some information about them as well. No sooner I started researching about linux, I realized that it was very vast. I realized almost everything on a linux system can be replaced by an alternative program.\nI came to know that the linux operating system is an Open Source operating system. I searched about open source too and got a simple idea that if the source code of a software is visible and changable by any people from anywhere than it is an open source software. (I didn't even know what a \"source code\" was and did some research about it too.)\nI followed linux youtube channals like Chris Titus Tech, The Linux Experiment, etc (Not DT because I didnt like his presentation even though he is my favourite youtuber as of now.) and began to watch their videos regularly. I really liked the concept of open source too, so I gradually started switching my phone apps to open source  apps like 'MX Player' to 'VLC', 'Chrome' to 'Brave', 'Google to Duckduckgo', etc.\nI researched about Linux and OpenSource for more than two years, then the Corona Virus struck, countries started lockdowns and everyone was trapped inside their houses. First year went without any classes not even online but when the second phase hit every school and colleges starting pushing online classes. And since both of my parents were teachers and a tiny smartphone didn't handle the online classes very well, we had to buy a computer. Then, in the beginning of 2021 we bought a laptop (This is the first ever full-fledged computer that I ever had in my own house.).\nJust the day after we bought the computer I was so curious that I wanted to install linux on my computer, I didnt find any pendrive on my house except an old 2GB pendrive that my father had, I backed up the pendrive to the windows and started searching for linux images. All the distros I wanted to try were more than 2 GB in size and then I decided to install arch linux. I read the documentation and watched some videos and sucessfully dual booted (Virtualization was a no-go because this computer had a HDD and 4GB of ram) my computer with Arch Linux and Windows.\nI started learning new things, especially the terminal and tested out different Desktop Environments and Window Managers(I couldn't use it). I starting using FOSS and one of the main perks of FOSS was \"Privacy\". Till then I used to make an account for each and every site I found, that too with my real name and primary email address. I learnt more about privacy and how we cannot trust the propraitory services and softwares. I used to use evernote, I migrated to Joplin. I started hating big tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Facebook etc.\nI started hating the algorithms that showed the feeds of my facebook, Instagram and Youtube. I started hating them for the fact that they collect a lot of information about us and our devices. I hated the fact that the required unnecessary permissions even to use their apps. I hated the fact that the messages were not end to end encrypted. I hated the fact that the posts weren't on a chronological order based on the time of the post published.\nI started searching for alternatives but the thing about social media is that I couldn't just find one and start using it because all my friends were on facebook and Instagram and not anywhere else. I couldnt convince the majority to make an account on an unknown platform where there's noone other than me. I made accounts on mastodon and matrix and started using them. I invited some of my friends to these platforms, some are still here and some already deleted their accounts.\nI recently deleted my facebook and snapchat account and  I will soon be deleting my Instagram account too. Matrix didn't seem to be easy to understand for the normal people so I am beginning to invite them to signal to be in touch with them.\nIn a few days I will be :\n\nDeleting my Instagram Account.\nInstalling a custom rom without google in it.\nMaking list and rss feeds of the people I follow on twitter and youtube.\nUsing as much open source as possible.\nBacking up my data from google to nextcloud.\n...and maybe more\n\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/destination-linux/","title":"My Journey to Linux and Privacy"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/dilemma/":{"body":"Am I supposed to work hard?\nOr should I only play smart?\nAm I supposed to beat all?\nOr do I help them not fall?\nIs breaking trust an easy path?\nOr is trust just some easy math?\nHarsh choices,\nbig decisions, I'm tired.\nChoose one,\nlose one, there's riot.\nLeave me,\nI'll do, my style.\nPin me,\nYou'll get, meat pile.\nStrong eye,\narrogant, I'll be.\nYield it,\nchicken, they'll see.\nRely on,\nexploited, be wreaked.\nTrust one,\nsole heart, it'll break.\nSoft heart,\neasy, knives in.\nRock hard,\nalone, have been.\nDrop out,\nPotential, limited.\nGive in,\nfault's own, betrayed.\nTough time,\nnone know, my itch.\nPriorities,\nunderstand, can't ditch.\nPressured,\nHot warm, blood type.\nEndgame,\nI want, my life.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/dilemma/","title":"Dilemma"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/distro/":{"body":"One operating syatem , thousand choices.\nLinux Distribution or Distro is an operating system based on a Linux Kernel which is configured in a certain manner. A typical Linux distribution comprises a Linux kernel, GNU tools and libraries, additional software, documentation, a window system (Xorg or Wayland), a window manager, and a desktop environment. They also vary upon what device they are made for ;desktops, servers, laptops, netbooks, mobile phones ,tablets or a toaster. There  are thousands of distros out there which have different and unique user experience. They are classified by packaging systems, installation method, user experience, software availablity, release cycle, philosophy, use cases, etc. So, a complete chart of classification is difficult to make.\nSome of the famous Linux distros are :\nArch\nArch Linux is an independently developed, x86-64 general-purpose GNU/Linux distribution that strives to provide the latest stable versions of most software by following a rolling-release model. The default installation is a minimal base system, configured by the user to only add what is purposely required.\n\nFile Mask - .pacman\nPackage Manager - pacman\n\nDebian\nDebian is a free operating system (OS) for your computer. Debian uses the Linux Kernel, and most of the basic OS tools come from the GNU project. Debian generally follows standerd relese cycles and is easy to install and run.\n\nFile Mask - .deb\nPackage Manager - apt\n\nRedhat\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux (often abbreviated to RHEL) is a Linux distribution developed by Red Hat for the commercial market. Red Hat Enterprise Linux is released in server versions for x86-64, Power ISA, ARM64, and IBM Z and a desktop version for x86-64. It too generally follows standerd relese cycles instead of rolling relese.\n\nFile Mask - .rpm\nPackage Manager - yum\n\nSlackware\nIt is the oldest currently existing linux distribution. Slackware provides no graphical installation procedure and no automatic dependency resolution of software packages. It uses plain text files and only a small set of shell scripts for configuration and administration. It too is a standerd relese distribution.\n\nFile Mask - .xz\nPackage Manager - slackpkg\n\nGentoo\nGentoo is a free operating system based on Linux that can be automatically optimized and customized for just about any application or need. It is a rolling release distribution. It's compiled locally according to the user's preferences and is often optimized for the specific type of computer.\n\nFile Mask - .tbz2\nPackage Manager - portage\n\nSUSE\nThe SUSE distribution is a stable, easy to use and complete multi-purpose distribution. It is aimed towards users and developers working on the desktop or server. It is a generally standard release distribution and is the first enterprise Linux provider of the world.\n\nFile Mask - .rpm\nPackage Manager - zypper\n\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/distro/","title":"Linux Distributions"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/diy-split-keyboard/":{"body":"Yeah! I keep doing stupid things.\nThe idea of remapping keys isn't new, be it for typing in a different language or to make the escape key more ergonomic for vim users.\nI mapped my escape key to ` and caps-lock key to escape when I bought my 65% keyboard.\nIt was because I had to use some weird function keybind just to type a ~. Then I realised my laptop key got remapped too, but I\njust went ahead with it. That is when I used this software called keyd.\nFast forward to today and rewind to a month back, I was bored out of my mind and was fidgeting with my keyboard when I popped one of the keys\nout of it. And right then I looked at the keys and wondered if I could make a minimal split keyboard out of it using keyd.\nI had watched many videos about split keyboards, and one was even in my wishlist for a long time. So, I wondered if I was gonna invest in a keyboard that is going to shape my typing muscle memory, I should at least give it a try beforehand.\nNow that I started writing about it, I don't think it was that big a deal. It only took too much of my time to configure it. First I tried the ferris sweep layout which was too much of a sacrifice, then I tried corne and finally decided on the 5 column corne.\nBefore Operation:\n\nAfter Operation:\n\n\nHere is the keyd configuration:\n\n\nI even vibe coded a layout visualiser to remember the keybinds.\nHappy Ending?\nWell, I could just lie and say that I have increased my productivity by 200% but, that is far from the reality. After I had fun changing the layout, I am just happy with the comfort of my laptop keyboard and have not used the split keyboard at all. I do use it sometimes but, I am so slow on it that I immidiately fall back to the laptop. It is obvious, it takes time to learn a split layout but, I am just not investing my time on it. Nevertheless, it was so damn fun while I configured it.\nProjects like keyd just keep the spirit of Linux alive.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/diy-split-keyboard/","title":"Almost splitting a Keyboard in Half"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/dracula-nova/":{"body":"'Dracula' everywhere!\nI have created a dracula themed nova launcher layout and wanted to share it.\nInstall using Git\nIf you are a git user, you can install the theme and keep up to date by cloning the repo:\n\nhttps://github.com/dracula/nova_launcher.git\n\nInstall manually\nDownload using the 'GitHub .zip download' option and unzip them.\n[Github .zip download]\nActivating theme\nWarning This will override your custom layout.

Before this I had tried Droidian about a year ago on this very device.\n\nNote: The screenshots attached here are of my customized version of phosh and GTK colors, the default UI will look different.\n\n\n  \n  \n\nA quick THEN v/s NOW\nThen, the UI was not tailored for the device I was using, it was vanilla phosh with clock in the center of the bar which was covered by the punch-hole of my device and the notification panel was also not aligned correctly to the device. Now, it's fine and the UI is just how it should be for the device.\n\n  \n  \n\nThen, The Camera was not working at all. Now, the droidian-camera does work but it's laggy. Though it technically can capture videos the frame rate drops very randomly and the video comes out to be choppy. The file size of the choppy video is also very high.\nThen, Apps like telegram and messenger from Firefox did not connect to calls at all. Now, microphone is generally supported by all apps and voice calling via other apps work fine.\nThen, Waydroid used to work without much problems. Now, upon launching Waydroid and trying to video-call the entire shell crashes and the only way to bring back the UI is by a forced restart.\nExperience\nGnome Asia 2023 is starting Tomorrow, I travelled from Dharan to Kathmandu with Droidian on my phone and it feels like I am handicapped using this device coming from android.\nVoice Calls\nSince it is a phone it should be able to make calls and it does. Though my device supports two SIMs, droidian on my device only detects and uses one so, I had to let go of my secondary SIM.\n\nNotifications\nApps should be running in the background to be able to make notifications, and the other thing is I am not notified with sound or vibration of any of my texts messages be it from apps like fractal, nheko, telegram-desktop or even gnome-messages even if the app is running in the background when the screen is off.\nThe gnome-calls app is the only app I know which can make \"noisy notifications\" when my phone is locked and the screen is off. So, I only know if anyone is calling me on my number but nothing if they use any other platform.\n\nMaps\nYes, Gnome Maps works on this device but it does not show my real time location. And coming from using Google Maps, it isn't a very pleasant of an experience.\n\nWaydroid\nThe waydroid experience was buggy when used in the default condition but it worked fine under a nested weston session. But, weston comes with a drawback. The resolution when used in the default phoc is great everything looks crisp but when used in a nested weston session the resolution is low and it's only usable. At least waydroid doesn't crash the whole phoc session when used inside the nested weston session.\nThe first image below is with 400dpi (in default phoc session) whereas the second one is on 1700dpi (in weston session) set from android developer settings.\n\n  \n  \n\nThough gnome-maps do not show real time location, google maps from waydroid is able to do it. But, it requires some time to load everything.\nWeb Browsing\nWeb browsing is fine in droidian. Firefox with a mobile focused custom layout is the default browser. There are some glitches here and there on firefox caused by the inability to adapt to a mobile form but normal day to day browsing can be done nicely. Various websites, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, everything works fine but not as smooth as using on desktop or android and it is expected because I am technically running a whole desktop application on a smartphone.\n\nThe desktop extensions work fine, but the UI to edit them from their window glitches on my device. So, the extensions which work by default work the best.\nSocial Media and Messaging\nWell, mastodon is my favourite social media ever and Tuba is a dedicated app from flathub which works more than fine for it. YouTube, Facebook and Instagram can be used from the Firefox browser. For communication, telegram-desktop works fine, so does Nheko for matrix supporting voice calls as well, other matrix clients like Fractal work too. And there always are web based clients that work in responsive mode.\n\n  \n  \n\nIt's not always gtk apps, qt apps are convergent too; telegram-desktop and nheko are two examples. They are the only \"apps\" which support voice calls natively and even video calls if it detects a camera (it doesn't in mine).\n\n  \n  \n\nFile Sharing\nSharing files is surprisingly important in our day-to-day life. Since it is a whole Linux system ssh can be used to transfer and receive files as well as modify it remotely. For a more GUI approach the best way to share files from any kind of device is the magic-wormhole protocol. And warp being the GTK convergent app for Droidian, it has made my life a lot easier.\n\n  \n  \n\nI am writing this blog on my laptop while taking screenshots from my phone and sending them to my laptop using warp.\nCustomization\nThe thing that introduced Linux to me and made it interesting was the customizability of it. I encountered Linux when YouTube recommended a video of KDE while I was searching for ways to customize windows. So, you can pretty much assume that I don't use things without giving some of my touch to it.\nColors and Textures\nAs I have mentioned before, the screenshots attached here are of my customized version of phosh and GTK colors. So, since it is basically a GTK environment, gradience works like a charm for changing the color palette of the apps. And for the phosh shell, some custom gtk.css on ~/.config/gtk-3.0/ will do the trick.\nHere, I am using the gruvbox theme to customize my shell.\n\n  \n  \n\n\nShell Tweaks\nChanging icons, showing battery percentage in the bar, setting themes enabling Application filter, everything was done with an app called postmarketos-tweaks which I compiled from the source.\n\n\n  \n  \n\nScaling\nThe default scale is good for the eyes but for me it was a bit too big. I wanted more stuff on this small screen of my phone. For that I went to /etc/phosh/phoc.ini and set the following:\n\nFinally...\nThe whole Linux ecosystem isn't convergent yet, and many apps go beyond the screen resulting in hidden buttons and texts. To tackle that problem, Droidian comes with Mobile Settings that helps to scale down particular apps so that they fit on the screen.\n\n  \n  \n\nIt would have been much better if it had...\nSome features like, the semi-automatic screen rotation that android has nowadays which would show a small prompt to rotate the screen upon rotating the device but without automatically rotating it. Also, gestures in apps like video players to scroll and double taps to skip, which would make the droidian experience much better. And, maybe a qr-code scanner to connect to wifi networks.\nLastly, Some Mentions\nWaydroid has been a life saver for using essential video calling apps and surprisingly banking apps. But, the default waydroid experience is very buggy. It is not the fault of droidian devs though, waydroid is a completely different project.\nGnome Online Accounts made it very easy to sync my contacts saved on google contacts, calender events, emails on droidian. It also connected my google drive with nautilus [Gnome Files] making it easy to upload and access files from my drive.\nSo,\nMy experience with Linux on Mobile was interesting, though it has a lot to improve, I didn't expect it to be \"functional enough\" that I could use it for days without diving back to android. I will use this for some more days, maybe until the Gnome Asia 2023 event ends.\nThere is lot more to try but, I want to end this experiment for now.\nGoodnight!\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/droidian/","title":"Droidian: Linux Smartphone Experience"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/e-reader-android/":{"body":"This time it is a really simple thing.

And I want to read books instead of consuming visual media.\nSo?\nFor a while now my YouTube recommendations were full of e-readers, dumb phones and modding kindles.\nI did like the idea and checked the price of those devices (Classic Consumerism).\nSince, they are manufactured in small quantities, they are very expensive for the specs they offer.\nAnd most of them are not available in my region.\nBut, my stubbornness, or maybe my addiction is so bad that I need to have what I want and if I don't I just can't do any other work properly.\nThen I thought, I cannot convert something dumb to something advanced by itself but the reverse is possible.\nI remembered a device called BOOX Palma and since it is an android device I thought I could recreate it with my own phone that I already have.\nFrom the kindle modding video I also realised that KOReader is not just an old, weirdly made e-book reader app.\nSo, I decided to base the entire personality of my phone to the KOReader app.\nPreparing Android\nSince I use a custom ROM it is much easier for me to customize my device to a greater potential than vanilla android that google offers. I use Project Infinity X.\n\nI wanted the B&amp;W monochromatic look of e-readers, so, the first thing I did is set a white background as my wallpaper.\nThe Monet color is set to be monochromatic.\nIn Accessibility &gt; Color and motion &gt; Use color correction &gt; Grayscale is turned on. (I just disable this via a quick setting toggle when I need colours.)\nIn Accessibility &gt; Color and motion &gt; Remove animations is turned on.\nIn Display &gt; Color &gt; Night Light is turned on.\nDark Theme is disabled.\nDisplay &gt; Display cutout is set to notchbarkiller. (This setting is generally in Developer Options if not in Display but, the exact name: notchbarkiller may not be present.)\nAdditionally, a Reading Mode can be made with the features like: disabling notifications and setting the screen as greyscale. But, I wanted to control those settings individually.\n\nInstalling the Launcher\n\nI decided to install InkOS as my launcher because it adds on to the e-reader aesthetic.\nI removed all the shortcuts of the home screen and set Books as the only shortcut there.\nFrom the app drawer I changed the name of the apps to their generic names and hid most of the unused apps.\nConfigured swipe left gesture to KOReader and swipe right to App Drawer.\nFinally I set InkOs as my default launcher.\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nHome Screen with a single books shortcut and Lock Screen with a big digital clock.\n\nSetting Up KOReader\n\nInstalled KOReader from GitHub and set it to Start with: last file.\nDisabled Cover Browser Plugin and installed Project: Title.\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nKOReader with The Shape of Design (Swiping Left) and the App Drawer (Swiping Right).\n\nIn KOReader individual books have their individual settings but once everything is set up, scaled and aligned properly for the book that you want to read, only reading it will be the remaining task.\nFinal Touches\nThe phone is normally is in DND mode, but when it is not, I have disabled the notifications of almost every app except signal.\nI have installed uBlock Origin on firefox and have hidden different UI elements that I don't want to see e.g. YouTube Shorts.\nThe quick settings panel is now cleared and only the very essential settings like WIFI, modes and colour correction toggles are there.\nAll in all, I have made reading books the easiest task on the phone and added friction to everything else by locking the apps so I have some time to realise what I actually want to do.\nI aim to read more books with this setup.

Or, maybe I was approaching it.\nI can not describe it the way I saw it but, this is the best description I can give you.\nIt looked like the sky had divided the ocean into two halves. The separation looked like two bubbles of soap merging.\nThe ocean was same, but the water, it felt different. The colour of the sky was same, that of the water was same but, it felt wrong, weird.\nI get closer and closer and closer. And then all of a sudden I had crossed it. I was at the other half of the earth.\nThe air was heavy, the water was muddy, the wind colder and the sky was white. It was bright but I couldn't find the sun.\nThe separation drifted further and further away from me. I began to sink. I could see a green patch of land from high above.\nI saw two little flowers; a red, and an orange dot. I switch hands again. My neck hurts, my throat is sore. But, I keep shouting.\nI am sinking down and as I sink the land got bigger. I could see the waves of grass as the wind glides through the field.\nThose weren't flowers, they were two little girls sitting on the grass.\nHelp! Hellllllp! I scream! But they can't hear me. I keep screaming and finally the girl in the orange sees me.\nShe stands up, pulls the other girl's hand and points toward me. The girl in the red stands up and starts running after me.\nI was a little relieved, but as the ground got closer my hand starts to give up.\nI hold the string tight with both my hands with all the energy left in me. But as I the ground gets nearer, the harder it gets to hold on.\nI put each and every ounce of my strength to it.

The white light faded away as I saw the clouds with blue patches of sky here and there.\nHalf the sky covered by the green leaves of a rain tree.\nI can feel a wet cloth in my forehead. Then, I hear a voice, \"Sister! The guy is awake! Come back.\"\nI try to get up, but I cannot. The girl in the red dress comes near me.\nI can see that she's wearing a red gown, it has a pattern of small yellow daisies. I look at her.\nFreckles on her cheeks, black eyes, her face is glowing, skin's dark and curly black hair that's shining brown as the light passes through it.\nShe is beautiful. She breaks a taro leaf near a puddle, gently folds it, scoops some water in it and asks her sister to slowly lift my head.\nI look at her, she is in a plain yellow dress, it has layers of white stripes in the neck and sleeves.\nGrey eyes, her skin is bright, hair's brown and a small mole on her left cheek just above her dimples as she smiles and gently raises my head.\nI take a sip of water, it was the best sensation I had ever felt in my whole life. I was alive, I slowly pulled myself up and leaned on the tree trunk.\nI look in front of me, it was only grassland spanning up to the horizon. Then the girl in the red gown spoke to me.\n\"What is your name?\"\nI don't know.\n\"Where did you come from?\"\nI don't remember.\n\"Do you remember anything?\", she asked.\nTrying to think I close my eyes.

This report will discuss on how to setup the microcontroller boards and how the communication will work for project manoid (A waste management robot). Also, the much difficult image processing and mapping is on the way, which I should be working on instead of writing this but I'll leave that for next year. Communication seems like a simple topic to work on for now.\n\nNote : I wrote the code for the bot manoid in arduino's '.ino' instead of using micropython's '.py' but micropython can be used to do the same as well.\n\nRequirements:\nCategoryComponent\nHardwareESP8266 Microcontroller\nFirmwareMicroPython (for receiving)\nSoftwarePython (for publishing)\nSoftwareesptool\nSoftwaremosquitto (for serving)\nSoftwareadafruit-ampy\n\nBasic Setup\nFlashing Firmware\nMicropython is an implementation of Python 3 that includes a small subset of the Python standard library and is optimised to run on microcontrollers and in constrained environments. The microcontroller I am using is the ESP8266 (NodeMCU). Flashing it with micropython was easy (for me), I've been flashing things since years. It goes like this:\n\nInstall esptool and erase flash your ESP8266 first.\n\n\nYou should first confirm that /dev/ttyUSB0 is your device which you want to flash micropython on.\n\n\n\nThen flash the latest firmware of ESP8266.\n\n\nThe default flashing mode worked on my first ESP8266 but when I tried to flash it to another ESP8266 it flashes successfully but didn't let me access the repl. So, I had to set the flashing mode to dout.\n\n\nCheck if everything is working by connecting to the micropython repl. You can use screen or tmux or your own solution to connect to the repl. Here is how you can use screen:\n\n\nThe above command gives you a blank screen, when you hit enter you'll get the prompt, type help and hit enter. This should show up:\n\nMQTT\nI am sure you played with the repl and now it's time to push some scripts to run in it. For now we will focus on using MQTT protocol to transfer data from one machine to another.\nAn overview of how MQTT works\n\nA MQTT client establishes a connection with the MQTT broker.\nOnce connected, the client can either publish messages, subscribe to specific messages, or do both.\nWhen the MQTT broker receives a message, it forwards it to subscribers who are interested.\n\n\nHere, server will be mosquitto running on the computer publisher will be the python script on the computer and subscriber will be the ESP8266 running micropython. [Message will be sent from python script through mosquitto server to ESP8266]\n\nMosquitto\nTo set the mosquitto server first we should allow port 1883 on your firewall. I am using a custom configuration file for now. So, make a file named mosquitto.conf and put the following lines to allow all connections:\n\nthen run the server by the following command:\n\nThis is how it'll look when a client named tesseraclient connects to the server:\n\nPushing Scripts to the Microcontroller\nThere are two important files that MicroPython looks for in the root of its filesystem.  These files contain MicroPython code that will be executed whenever the board is powered up or reset (i.e. it 'boots').  These files are:\nboot.py\nThis file is run first on power up/reset and should contain low-level code that sets up the board to finish booting.\nmain.py\nIf this file exists it's run after boot.py and should contain any main script that you want to run when the board is powered up or reset.\nTo push the scripts I am using adafruit-ampy but the official way to push files is using their webrepl.\nUsing ampy you can push scripts with the following command:\n\nProgramming\nPublisher\nFirstly a python script on the computer to send messages, it sends on and off in the interval of 500ms with topic led to the mosquitto server:\n\nSubscriber\nboot.py\nThis will start when I plug the esp to the power supply. No need to connect via webrepl and start manually. Generally it's not recommended to touch the boot.py file. main.py should be used instead but this is I who programming the microcontroller so boot.py it is.\n\nmqtt.py\nUpon connecting to the WIFI successfully the above script will import this file and things magically happen.\n\nFinally\nIf everything works after installing all the python dependencies you will see this if you are supplying power to your microcontroller using a computer that can accept serial in upon doing a soft reboot and running your python (publisher) script from your computer.\n\nThis indicates that the publisher i.e. python script has connected to the server i.e. mosquitto and is now sending on and off messages to the server with topic led which then is sent to the subscriber i.e. ESP8266 which is interpreted by the microcontroller as a command to enable and disable the set GPIO pin i.e. pin 15 if you look closely at the code.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/esp-mosquitto/","title":"Manoid: Communication"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/existance/":{"body":"With the big bang\nDust was formed.\nThose combined\nStars were born.\nSome big some small,\nrocks were found.\nThey revolved around\nand then turned round.\nWith passage of time\ngalaxies were formed.\nOne of the galaxies,\nis our home,\nwhich contains a star\nthat we call sun.\nIt was burning\nIt was big.\nA ball of fire\nrevolved around it.\nAs the ball\nstarted to cool\nSomething called water\nbegan to drool.\nOn the water\nlife was formed.\nAs life grew up,\nit used the sun.\nSeeing the sun\nup came plants.\nThey were everywhere\non water , on land.\nWith plants on land\nfishes came up\nBreathing under water\nliving on sand.\nThen they left water,\nland was home.\nOn the forests\nthey began to roam.\nThey grew up\nwith the trees.\nAlso started flying\nlike birds and bees.\nLike the trees\nthey were huge.\nWith their presence\nearth would lose.\nAnd then one day.\nthe sky was bright.\nBig ones slept\nthe remaining were light.\nSmall creatures\nbegan to hide\nunder the ground\nwithout any light.\nThe earth was cold\neverything was freezing.\nIt was ice age\nwhen they were living.\nAs the ice\nbegan to melt,\nAll the creatures\nrelieved they felt.\nThe trees were back\nthe sun was warm.\nThe birds started flying\nand bees with swarm.\nThe apes came up\nand, then came men.\nMen built houses\nMen made farms\nThat was how,\nwe evolved.\nAll with time\nwe filled the earth.\nWith cities and kingdoms\nFights were fought.\nAfter all settled\nwe all were one,\nWe made tech.\nwe made phones.\nSuddenly the earth\nwas small as stones.\nOn that earth\nThey both were found.\nThen they married\nthe oath was sworn.\nThey were together,\nlove was grown.\nAnd that is how\nYou were born.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/existance/","title":"You Were Born"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/facebook-a-choice-not-an-obligation/":{"body":"A brief reminder of the freedom of choice and privacy.\nLast year, I decided to ditch Facebook and meta in overall because of the raising privacy concerns and addictive nature of these mainstream social media platforms. Of course backed by my knowledge of privacy and the help of different online communities, especially the Linux community talking about internet privacy and the openness of FOSS I quickly realized that the world of internet is not a very good place to be in, especially the social media platforms without federation and very high filtration of what people can/not, want/not to see. I realized that the posts that I am scrolling through are picked and compiled for my tastes and to keep me stuck in the place for so long that I see enough ads and decide to buy one of the products that I see is what I want but don't need.\nI felt that the social media should not have any filtration over its contents by a person to person basis but have a good moderation for a set of people/community where one thing of one community may think what they are doing is good/legal while the other communities because of their social norms sees bad/illegal. Another thing is the arrangement of posts, the posts should be arranged in a chronological manner with respect to time (new posts on the top and older at the bottom.). It should be private and should have an ability to federate with other platforms if one decides to not use it but wants to be in touch with the people inside it. And last but not the least It should be open by which everyone is ensured that they are safe and the company/organization is not using our data for their own betterment behind our back.\nBut what you get is not always what you want. I had to make a Facebook account because my university circulates all its regular notice via Facebook and only Facebook, despite them having a website of their own where they do post some very specific notices. I could have lived with the university's specific notices but every other group/club/association; the club for students interested in robotics, in software development, associations of computer, civil, etc  engineering students, etc inside my university share information solely on Facebook which I being someone interested in robotics as well as software really want to know.\nIt could be a whole different story if anyone except I were concerned about their privacy and/or didn't use Facebook with one reason or another. But even if I proposed a solution it will be just for me, and they will eventually stop following it and keep posting on Facebook as they are doing right now.  I quote Olamundo from mastodon (@olamundo@red.niboe.info), \"Having a Facebook account is an option (which highly educated people are expected not to take, considering current news and concerns), not an obligation.\"\nIt's very difficult to maintain privacy on the internet, either you have to completely disconnect from them or keep using what they give without even considering if privacy was a thing.\nProposable Solutions :\n\nUsing a website for everything with support for RSS.\nUsing mastodon or any other federated social media for notice circulation, along with some sort of redirection to it for Facebook.\nUsing MATRIX w/o bridges for those who don't want an account on discord/messenger and still be able to contact with everyone.\nUsing discourse or similar software for notice as well as chats.\nAnything that doesn't require any specific non privacy respecting software and is accessible by everyone.\n\nLinks:\nInformation on\nRSS (subscription method for websites)\nFederated Social Media (Mastodon, Pleroma etc.)\nMatrix (bridging chat platforms.)\nDiscourse (a forum for community)\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/facebook-a-choice-not-an-obligation/","title":"Facebook a Choice, Not an Obligation"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/fear/":{"body":"Why is this thing in my mind?\nIs it what is keeping me alive.\nI just can't be afraid all my life.\nIt feels like I'm loosing the fight.\nWhy am I acting like I'm high?\nIt feels like I'm burning inside.\nI have searched it far and wide.\nCan anyone please show me light.\nAre decisions getting hard to make?\nThis is what is keeping me awake.\nAfraid that I'm never gonna make.\nI keep failing the tests they take.\nAm I really getting depressed?\nThink I need some time to rest.\nDespite of giving all my best.\nI have always failed to impress.\nWhy am I even writing this poem?\nMaybe to bury sorrow with rhyme.\nOnly thing that makes me whine,\nThat I just  have not a lot of time.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/fear/","title":"Fear"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/fediverse/":{"body":"A Group of Social Media Platforms Using Common federation Protocols.\nFediverse is an interconnected network of different services like Social Networking, Microblogging, Blogging, Video Hosting, File Hosting, and other services which can be independently hosted on different servers but can still communicate with each other.

I always find something very interesting to do every time an exam is around. This semester, I went into a rabbit hole of customizing Firefox to make it minimal (or immersive), I'd say.\n\n  \n  \n\n\nimg: homepage and tabs-expanded view\n\n\n\nimg: webpage view\n\nI am very much into customization, and I like to keep changing things around. When I was using gnome in arch Linux some years back I had come across rafaelmardojai/firefox-gnome-theme which I immediately installed to make my system consistent with the libadwaita style. That was the time when I realized the repo had almost 100% CSS in the GitHub language thingy bar. I knew what CSS was but never bothered to look into the Firefox theme, it simply worked.\nFast-forward to a few months ago, the arc browser had the internet going crazy about it. I did like the UI being minimal and focused on viewing websites, hiding the settings that would normally show up all the time. Since you had to make an account to just use the browser, I didn't use it. Then I went searching for themes that replicated the UI on Firefox itself. I found KiKaraage/ArcWTF which I used for a while. This time I modified the CSS and restarted Firefox and kept on updating the CSS and restarting Firefox until I got what I wanted. I hated that I had to restart Firefox to apply the small change in userChrome.css that I was going to repeat because I didn't know what I was doing.\nI am currently using nix, so, eventually this was to come. I had to configure my Firefox with home-manager. This caused me to leave behind my arcWTF css because there was no easy way to simply put the chrome folder in its place with nix. But, there was a way to write userChrome within the nix configuration. This way of changing CSS was even more of a hassle because I had to first write it inside nix with no LSP for CSS, then I had to evaluate the nix file to put things into place and then restart Firefox.\nAaah! That was really clunky but, I then made single userChrome.css and userContent.css files and then just imported them with nix to read the file instead of writing the CSS inside the .nix file, and it was a little better. Now started my journey to make the most minimal and at the same time good Firefox userstyle in a single .css file. I then found simplefox a goldmine for minimal Firefox config, but there was a single issue, I was used to the tabs being tree style and on the left sidebar. So, I installed sidebery and got some CSS from arcWTF to make the collapsed sidebar work.\nThen I got a new laptop, which currently has windows, but It has a gorgeous screen which in comparison to the previous laptop is the difference of 70% more DCI-P3 with a 3k OLED screen. I copied my CSS from my NixOS machine, and it was working pretty well. Until I had an idea to improve it further. For days, I kept editing the CSS and restarting my Firefox to change the .css with hit and trial getting more failures than success in the style actually being like I intended it to be. And then yesterday I was fed up with doing that and actually searched if there was a way of doing that without restarting Firefox (live).\nSurprise, surprise, it was not just possible but intentional. I wished I had known about this before. You just do the following things:\n\nOpen the hamburger menu.\nGo to more tools.\nClick on web developer tools.\nThe web developer interface will open, now on the top right side of the toolbox,\nClick on the 3 dot menu.\nClick on settings.\nEnable two options:\n\n\n\n\nThen go to hamburger menu &gt; more tools &gt; browser toolbox or the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+Alt-I.\nThen it'll ask for confirmation with the following prompt:\n\n\n\nAllow it and the toolbox opens. Go to the style editior from the menu.\nFind userChrome.css and enjoy live tinkering. When you are done, just click on save or Ctrl+S and it is permanent.\nFor userContent.css just come to the Firefox homepage and hit Ctrl+Shift+C, go to the style editor and find the userContent.css.\n\nFinally\nI created this beautiful Firefox userstyle with a focus on minimalism and web content.

The arm is designed to be controlled with natural hand gestures removing the need to look at the buttons on a screen or a controller to control it.\nMaterials Used:\n\nArduino Uno\n16 Channel Servo driver\nBuck Converter\nJumper Cables\n3D Printed MK2 Chassis\n4 Servos\nA Portable Computer with Camera\n\nSoftware Used:\n\nArduino IDE V2\nPython 3\n\nDesign:\nThe first step in building the CV controlled arm is to make a schematic of it. The arm is based on the MK2 Model, which is pretty easy to 3D-print and assemble. 4 servos are used for the base, the lower arm, the upper arm and the gripper. The servos are connected to the Servo Driver and the Servo Driver is connected to 5 volts DC power. The Arduino is used to control the Servo Driver to send PWM signals to servo.\nThe decisions for what signals to send for recognized gestures handled by a Python script which sends serial to Arduino via the USB. The Arduino receives the signal which is now converted to mechanical output.\nConstruction:\nThe assembly of the base is a bit tricky with gears and servos to be attached to it, but the upper part is easily attached. The four servos are placed on the right place according to MK2 schematics and are connected to 16 Channel Servo Driver. (I connected 0,2,4 and 7 as base, lower arm, upper arm and gripper respectively on the Servo Driver.) While connecting the Servo Driver to Arduino; the VCC is connected to 5 volts and Grounds of Arduino and Servo Driver are connected. From Arduino the analogue 5 pin is connected to SCL and analogue 4 pin is connected to SDA respectively.(This connects the Servo Driver to the Arduino.)\nThe servo diver is connected to 5 volts DC converted from 12 volts power supply using a buck converter. USB connected to the Arduino supplies power to Arduino as well as the Servo Driver but not the Servos connected to the Driver. The USB also doubles as a data transmission device to send serial input to the Arduino from the laptop running the python script.\nProgramming\nIn Arduino:\n\nIn Laptop:\n\nTesting:\nThe arm was completed, and it was time to test it. The servos were connected to power supply and the USB was connected to the Arduino. With the necessary code uploaded to the Arduino, the python script was run, and hand gestures were read from the computer which then converted to Serial signals and the code in Arduino interprets those Serial signals as per the uploaded code. Here, in the first trial reading the Front and Back side of the hand gave same results, I replaced the code for Left and Right aligned hand, which showed Right when I showed my right-hand palm to the Camera, and left when I showed my right-hand back to the camera, and vice-versa for the left hand. Which fixed the issue.\nChallenges and Solutions:\nThere were not many challenges to make a working prototype which my arm is at the moment. But further improvement on the gestures are going to be challenging like; to read and interpret natural human arm movements in digital form and to match the movement of robot arm with an actual human arm.\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, the CV robotic arm is a working prototype for better control of devices requiring less time to adapt. It helps people to be familiar with using complex devices like robotic arm in a very short period of time.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/gesture-controlled-arm/","title":"Project Pieyes"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/here-i-lie-with-truth/":{"body":"There's a lot of things going on in my mind, right now.\nToo many things I want to bring them out, but how?\nPain, mistakes, regrets, just aches that I have, oh wow!\nThings I wish that I had stopped doing by now, no doubt.\nEvery nice thing I try to do goes wrong, you know?\nBreak yourself along with the people you love, oh no!\nI tend to win them back with some more truth, although!\nThey wont ever know the darker side of me, just hope.\nLove others like the way you love yourself? please don't!\nGave my whole heart away but she did't want it.

And here I am talking about Nix not nix*. It is nix* but not that nix* but you can use it in most kind of nix* if the nix* you mainly know are most linux distros and macos.\nConfusing right? No! I made it confusing! Home manager is just a tool to write all your configurations (.dotfiles) in a cosy Nix language and is primarily inspired by the NixOS and use the Nix package manager. Well, a little confusing because the OS is called Nix, the language is called nix and also the package manager is called Nix, and at last all unix based systems are also in combination known as nix*(with an astrisk in the end).\n\nOkay, one last time. Home manager is just a tool to manage the dotfiles using the Nix language, leveraging the power of the Nix package manager and is inspired by the NixOS configuration. It focuses heavily on reproducability being distro agnostic despite of being focused around NixOS.\nStill pretty confusing right? Well, it is what it is.\nHow I use it\nI am writing this blog on my new windows machine, inside WSL in a NixOS-WSL distro where most of my configuration files are managed by Home Manager. And this home manager configuration is the same configuration that I use in my NixOS system, with just the configurations of the graphical applications removed.\nPretty cool right? It even works on windows(technically not, but still). I use it to manage bash, git, lazygit, helix, newsboat, starship, zellij, zoxide and other applications in the terminal world and alacritty, firefox, foot, imv, mpv, sioyek, spotify and other tools in the graphical realm. And I have used it in linux, on mac, currently in windows via WSL and even on android inside Nix-on-Droid recycling the same configurations everywhere. See? all major operating systems (technically inside linux except mac) and on both ARM and x86 architecture.\nWhy use it\nIt is one of those things that you think is very time consuming and difficult to manage and use but it saves time on the long run. You can easily transafer your application configurations from one device to another in a file(technically, because you would not want to write all the configs of all your things in a single file) and Nix will handle installations and setup of all those applications using just that file. All you need is nix to be installed on your system. And since, nixpkgs is the biggest package repository among any linux distribution I dont even think of using any other package manager to install things even if I am on any non NixOS distributions. And the cherry on top, everything will be version controlled using git(you will be forced to, haha) so you will never lose your precious configurations(even the history).\nHow to use it\nFirst and foremost, you need nix(the package manager) installed on your system. Then I suggest you to enable flakes and nix-command in your nix.conf file though they are experimental features. Despite the fact that they are experimental features, they are already widely adopted and are instead preferred by nix users over the traditional method.\nThen initialize a flake on a directory, add the home manager inputs as they tell you in the documentation on how to use home manager with flakes. Then write your configurations. Finally, switch to your new home manager configuraton.\nIn short, follow the docs and you'll be set. And maybe as a head start watch vimjoyer's video on home-manager.\nLastly...\nI just love nix and it's ecosystem and I am pretty biased toward it. Home manager may not be your cup of tea but give nix a try, using it as a secondary package manager for your distribution like you use flatpaks and snaps. It may not be regualr user friendly but it is very developer/tinkerer friendly if you even scratch a tiny surface of it. That's all I've got to say today, see ya.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/home-manager/","title":"Home Manager: Cosy Home With Nix"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/how-i-use-the-internet-today/":{"body":"Today's internet is a nightmare to use and navigate, in my opinion. I have little knowledge about the old internet. So, I don't have much to say about it, but from what I have experienced in the old internet is that it was actually decentralized. Firstly,  our internet is occupied by the tech giants. When I talk about the internet, a normal person would think that it's something that makes Facebook work or something that helps us to chat with people in WhatsApp. The concept of internet being a social, decentralized hub where people can express themselves in their own way has been shadowed by the famous monopoly, i.e. meta(in my opinion, but there's google as well), and now it is seen as the place where we play by the rules of a company and express ourselves in short microblogs with limited number of words and a single UI where everyone is forced to be in the same place because they will be alone if they want to try something new.\nThe other things are search engines and advertisements. The search engines today show us results which are paid for by the owner to show on the top of the search result or optimized in such a way that the search engines will show us the particular sites on the top. Either way, it provides people to choose specific words and hijack the search results of a person, shadowing the factual results. Many websites that I see on the top are websites written by bots and hosted just for the sake of people clicking it and watching their ad, i.e. to earn money without any real information.\nTalking about ads, the ads too are harmful nowadays. The ads today are mostly targeted and changes according to the user's web usage and interests. Targeted ads may be a good way to earn money from but are equally bad because it can be about anything, a news website might have ads for a gambling app or a good writer may have an ad which supports something illegal. They are not chosen and trusted by the owner of the website which puts their reputation in danger as well as the person surfing a good website may get scammed because they trusted the ad from the site they trust.\nNow let's get to the Topic\nBrowser\nThe first thing I need even before I access the internet is a browser. I prefer the Firefox browser because it helps the world by saving us from the monopoly that is chromium/chrome. The thing is that,  every device today comes pre-installed with chrome and even if you go and get a browser from the internet it is most likely to be a chromium based browser (Opera, Vivaldi, Microsoft Edge, Brave, UC Browser etc.) if it isn't Firefox. If Firefox was not a thing, the web would have been controlled by a sole company, i.e. google, whose main aim is to give as much ad to the people so that they can earn money.\nFirefox\nSearch Engine\nAfter I have Firefox installed, I prefer to choose a search engine which doesn't show targeted ads and works most of the time. I choose DuckDuckGo for that, but you may have your own preference. DuckDuckGo or DDG for short claims that it's a privacy focused search engine, but they seem to have better results than google for not being a sell-out. It's not perfect, and I do get websites written by bots or scams there as well, but is a \"good guy\" than google.\nDuckDuckGo\nContent Blocker\nNow that I have Firefox with DuckDuckGo, I need a content blocker. My choice in it is uBlock Origin every single time. It's a must-have add-on to surf the web without being covered by pop-ups and ads. It removes most of the ads as well their spaces in the websites, so you don't get blank spaces in the middle of an article or post. Furthermore, it also has advanced features like the ability to remove specific elements from a website, which comes in handy when it cannot remove stuff completely or if I want to remove something from a website that's bothering me to read something there.\nuBlock Origin\n\nDoing all this is mostly enough for a normal internet user because it solves most of the things that the modern internet forces upon us.\n\nTiny Little Details\nContainerization\nI use an add-on made by Firefox called Firefox Multi-Account Containers which allows me to keep all the parts of my online life contained in different tabs colour coded and labelled, helping me to keep different activities or sites separate from each other. What it does is that it allows me to do shopping stuff in one container and research stuff in another without the cross site cookies being shared with each other, making my shopping life not interfere to my academic life.\nFirefox Multi-Account Containers\nYum! Cookies\nCookies are small files sent to your browser from websites you visit. These files monitor the sites you visit and the items you click on these pages. These are used to remember what you did in a particular site the last time you visited it. I mostly reject cookies and allow only the essential ones. And to automate the process I use an add-on called \"I don't care about cookies\" which blocks the pop-ups and if the cookies are essential it accepts it and I never have to do the annoying thing every time you open a new website.\nI don't care about cookies\nPassword Manager\nWith an abundance in social platforms and having to use multiple things being a heavy internet user, I need to have multiple accounts with multiple passwords and authentication process. So, to manage my password I use Bitwarden, which helps me save a lot of time as well because I log out from everything every time I close my browser.\nBitwarden\nEnhancers\nI use sites like YouTube, mastodon and hacker news and I don't like the experiences there, it may have to do with design or any other things like bringing back the dislike counter on YouTube. I use add-ons like stylus, sponsor-block, return YouTube dislike, YouTube enhancer etc. to improve my experience.\nReturn YouTube Dislike\nStylus\nNavigation\nI am a vim guy and having vim keys bidden to the browser is just that cherry on top that I needed. For that, I use an add-on called \"Vimium\" which does exactly that.\nVimium\n\nEveryone has their own use-cases and people use the internet for multiple things. Following my method and using my configuration may not be viable for everyone, but it works for the most part. The best way to improve your experience is to use the internet and experiment with it to set it up to your liking.\n\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/how-i-use-the-internet-today/","title":"How I use the Internet Today"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/html/":{"body":"A standard markup language for documents in the web.\nHTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is a language that makes the documents of the website readable to human which we normally see while browsing the web. It was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. We don’t know the exact date of HTML creation, since it was a long term project, but the birthdate of the first HTML website is known to be on August 6, 1991.  The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called \"HTML Tags\", first mentioned on the Internet by non other than Tim Berners-Lee.\nEvery webpage may actually be a HTML file. Each HTML file is just a plain-text file, but with a .html file extension instead of .txt, and is made up of many HTML tags as well as the content for a web page.\nA website may often contain many html files that link to each other. HTML files can be edited with any kind of text editor since it is just a text file.\nHTML tags are the hidden keywords within a web page that define how your web browser must format and display the content.\nMostly tags have two parts, an opening and a closing part. For example,  is the opening tag and  is the closing tag. The closing tag contains the same text as the opening tag, but has an additional forward-slash ( / ) character in front of the word.\nCSS - Styling HTML\nCSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets It is the preferred way for setting the look and feel of a website.It define the colour, size and position of text and other HTML tags, while the HTML files define the content and how it is organized. Separating them allows you to change the colour scheme without having to rewrite your entire website.Since it's cascading, setting the colour of body text will mean all headings and paragraphs within the body will also be the same colour.\nWorld's first HTML site is still running, wanna check it out?\nWorld's First HTML Website\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/html/","title":"HTML"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/hug/":{"body":"\n\nI'll keep you warm, I'll tuck you tight.\nYou'll never want to leave.\nYou'll lose track of time, you'll realize.\nMy love is addictive.\nI'll hold your hands, I'll make you dance.\nYou'll want me even more.\nYou'll compete with me, you'll want to win.\nOn who loves whom the most.\nWe'll go on a walk, I'll make you laugh.\nYou'll forget your way back home.\nYou'll want me to rest, stick me to your chest.\nAnd kiss me on your own.\nI won't just try, I'll never lie.\nYou'll miss me when I'm far.\nYou'll want me so bad, that you'll start,\nwishing me to the stars.\nI'll be your man, and by your side.\nIn sadness and hard times.\nWhen you are sad, I'll make you sleep.\nWith my lullabies and rhymes.\nI'll keep you awake, we'll talk all night.\nOur future and past lives.\nYou'll share with me, the secrets you keep.\nBeyond mere truth and lies.\nI'm always there, for you in need.\nYou'll always have a friend.\nYou'll think of me, and the things we did.\nHoping it never ends.\nI wish to give, a gift so sweet.\nYou'd wish that you were mine.\nA hug so firm, and full of love.\nIt transcends space and time.\n\n\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/hug/","title":"Hug"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/humans/":{"body":"And he said...\nWe humans are pathetic for hiding our emotions, the only thing that makes us humans.\nNothing is visual, nothing is apparent, nothing is what it seems like it is.\nIf only it was simple, to understand the person sitting in front of you smiling.\nBut, we never know what a person is feeling just by asking them.\nYet the words that describe emotions are getting heavier,\nI am happy, I am sad, I am unsatisfied, I am confused, I am worried, I am angry, I am sad, I am sad, I am sad, I am at the verge of depression..........\n\n\tImportant\n\tIf there are italic voices inside \"(parenthesis)\" then that it is me talking to myself in my head, feel free to ignore my head.\n\n\nThe problem is even worse in the social media.\nThe moment you stop interacting with them in real like, poof they are the happiest people on earth.\nYet, nobody is happy in this beautiful place #nature #mother_earth #savetheplanet.\nEveryone has a problem to share and nobody wants a do what it takes (or get help) to solve their problem.\n(Ironically, this sentence proves that I am a \"man\".)\nStill, As our world is getting to a point that a piece of glass is how we understand people,\n(Both, the people we meet in real life and the people we \"meet\" in the magic mirror.)\nwe are moving away from our own identity in nature, the feeling of knowing the things(especially people) we interact with.\nThe another problem is the ability to ignore(in other words, run away from interactions and confrontations)\nis supercharged by an arrangement of rocks that can think.\n(thinking about it, we too are arrangements of rocks that can think, but you get the point.)\n\n\tNote\n\tThis is a checkpoint, congratulations!

We(I?) have lost our(my) abilty to focus.\nWe need something to stimulate us all the time.\nThe time table is something like this:\n\nWell, we never know when the thing we despise becomes a short break, then a habit and finally the ultimate form: addiction.\nI mean I hate social media, and yet I find myself endlessly scrolling and while still being aware of it multiple times a day.\nMy excuse to it for myself is: I love technology, I am pursuing a career in it and well this is a part of it, it is how I become\nup to date to the things I need to know. Otherwise, I will be behind this race(Basically FOMO). Sometimes I try to focus on\nonly things that I think matters and control myself of being overly simulated and the next day(withdrawls start) all night scroll compensating\nthe day before.\n\n\tWarning\n\tDo not just take this story as fiction. Ignorance in this case, isn't bliss.\n\n\nI wish \"living\" was simple, talking to people was simple, sharing your views was simple, sharing achievements (showing off) was simple, sharing pain was simple; but nothing is.\nI am an introvert, I have no friends, I have no one to talk to, I am not what people expect; all these feeling hit everyone at least once\nin our lives but the problem is that mostly they all hit at once(Could it, be.. any worse? #chandler).\nBut, it seems that this is normal.\nEach generation perceives life differently. The entire perspective of life seen by our grandparents is different from our parents and is different from how we perceive the world and I wonder the tension of views it creates when all the generations with their own good perspective of the world are together in the same place(imagine them living in the same place).\nA grandchild disagreeing to both their father/mother's and grandparent's way of thinking (In this sentence, all three generations can be permuted to any place.) is the best way to create hate amongst family members. This is why, living alone and meeting people only during special occasions works best to have a healthy family. (\"I guess\", because I haven't scientifically collected the data to say it with confdence.)\n\n\tTip\n\tAssume that you are reading the mind of a person who is struggling to write what they want to write. That way this story feels more natural.\n\n\nWe humans are the superior animals because we can reason, then change and adapt. You might argue that other animals change and adapt too, but the adaptation they go through is from natural selection not through intelligence.

Goodbye Evernote !\nEvernote\nProbably the world's most used note taking app. It's simple yet powerful. You can use it for free on 3 devices with not much limitation from pro features. I have used Evernote (Free) since April 16th, 2018. It has been my must have tool for years. The data gets backed up in their server. It is fast and simple to sync my data even if I uninstalled the app. It has many tools to format the text as I like. It also has a web clipper that gets a webpage clipped on my note. It groups notes in notebooks and can tag them too.Overall it's a powerful note taking app which is well designed and beautiful.\nJoplin\nJoplin is an open source note taking app having similar features to Evernote. It has the ability to backup your notes on the cloud of your choice. I even have an option to store my notes on their own cloud for some payment. The text formatting is done in markdown so it is sufficiently powerful for me. It also has a web clipper. it has the ability to group notes in Notebooks as well as tag them. It is one of the most powerful open source note taking application.\nI recently migrated from Evernote to Joplin and wanted to document the process. ( Without the need to pay for syncing notes in the cloud similar to Evernote Free )\nSteps\nCreating a Free Nextcloud Account (For free syncing)\nCreating a free Nextcloud account is easy. First, sign up with your choice of server from the given link.\nSign up!\nThen delete unwanted things from your Nextcloud storage (Optional). Normally you get 2 - 5 GB of free storage. That's enough for keeping notes. You can keep other documents too if you want.\nExporting Notes From Evernote\nTo export notes, follow these steps :\n\nOpen Evernote Desktop.\nGo to Notebooks.\nClick of the options icon and choose export notes.\nChoose the format as markdown (Evernote).\nSpecify the export folder.\nDo this for every Notebooks you want exported.\n\nImporting Notes To Joplin\nTo import notes to Joplin, follow these steps :\n\nOpen Joplin Desktop.\nGo to files option.\nSelect import notes.\nNavigate to the folder where you exported the notes from Evernote.\nSelect and import the notes one-by-one.\nAfter importing there might be some minor mis-formatting of text.\nEdit your notes to be perfectly formatted.\n\nIntegrating Joplin to Nextcloud\n\nOn Joplin go to it's settings.\nGo to synchronization.\nChange the initial cloud to Nextcloud. (You can use Dropbox if you want)\nOpen your web browser and get into your Nextcloud.\nSelect the hamburger menu, there you'll see a WebDAV URL, copy it.\nCome to Joplin and paste the WebDAV URL.\nInput your email and password.\nCheck the synchronization, It should work !\n\nConfiguring it to sync with Android/IOS\n\nDownload and open Joplin.\nGo to Configuration\nOn the synchronization section, select Nextcloud.\nInput WebDAV URL, Email and Password like you did in desktop.\nCheck the synchronization, will definitely work!\n\nDon't Worry , Be Happy!\nHere!\nYou have successfully migrated from Evernote to Joplin. Now use Joplin like you used Evernote.\n\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/joplin/","title":"Evernote to Joplin"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/kde-network-nepal/":{"body":"KDE?\nSomewhere around 2017, I started using Linux. KDE was the first Distro I ever tried. It was the whole reason why I switched to Linux. Now that I realize, it was actually KDE Plasma I was attracted to and I still love it. I can make my desktop however I want it to look, that was enough for me to step to the Linux world. KDE also makes a good deal of other software and not just plasma, Kdenlive and Krita being two of the most popular products. I particularly love Kstars to track stars and constellations when I am stargazing.\n\nNetwork Nepal\nKDE isn't a company of sorts, it's a community. A group of people sharing interests with each others and developing software for everyone. And not just any kind of software, high-end Free/Libre and Open Source Software. People are the heart of the community and the more people there are the better will be KDE.\n\nKDE Network?\nThe KDE Network is a group of KDE representatives in their respective cities/countries. They promote KDE, and it’s work in their local community.\n\n\nAfter learning about the KDE Network and a way to contribute to KDE as a Student. I had proposed an idea of a KDE Network for Nepal to represent KDE in Nepal to my friends and simultaneously to the KDE Promo team. Due to the support of KDE Promo team especially @aniqakhokhar and @paulb from the team, I along with my fellow FOSS geek friends decided to Introduce the Network from an Introductory event along with KDE 6 Megarelease celebration.\n\nWe hosted a meetup for students interested in Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). The event welcomed freshmen from computer engineering and electronics communication and information engineering programs, alongside some sophomores and juniors.\nThe meetup covered a range of FOSS topics, including what it is and how it works. Attendees learned about Linux, its components, and the KDE Plasma desktop environment. They also explored the KDE software collection, and then got to know what the Network was. To make the event fun, there was a KDE trivia quiz too!\n\nAlong with us, some students shared their experiences with FOSS, making the meetup a great interactive session. Everyone had a chance to learn from each other, and it was a window to the exciting world of open-source software for many students.\nI'm excited to organize future events showcasing the exciting ecosystem of KDE software and Linux, spreading the knowledge of FOSS to a wider audience.

It is very Powerful, I can say that it is the best among all the Phone - Computer integration softwares across all the operating systems. The Features of KDE connect are as follows :\nSharing Files\nYou can send files to or from the computer very easily. It can either be done by opening the app and choosing the 'Send Files' option or just by opening the share menu from the file and choosing the recieving device.\nMultimedia Control\nYou can pause, play, rewind, foreward, turn volume up or down from each device connected via KDE Connect. You can control the media on your phone from your computer or you can control the media on your computer from your phone.\nPresentation Remote\nYou can turn your phone to a presentation remote if you need it. It can use the accelerometer and gyroscope sensor to detect the motion and point on the area on your screen just by moving your phone in the air. You also can change slides from the app itself.\nRemote Input\nYou can use KDE Connect as a trackpad and a keyboard for your computer of you need.  This functionality can be set both ways, you can also use your computer to type things on your phone. It also can bring mouse like functionality where it creates a mouse pointer on your phone which can be used via the computer.\nBrowse Your Phone's Storage\nKDE Connect uses sshfs to connect your phone's storage to your computer wirelessly. You can edit, move, copy, rename, etc the files of your phone via your computer in it's file manager. You can basically do anything you can do with the file manager.\nFind Your Device\nYou can use your computer to ring your phone or use your phone to ring your computer if can't find one.\nSync Notifications\nYou can receive the Notifications of your phone on your computer as well as can receive the Notifications of your computer on your phone. You also can reply from the other device if it support replying from heads up notification.\nSend Text Messages\nYou can send messages to your contacts from your computer without needing to touch your phone if you prefer texting via cell network.\nClipboard Sync\nYou can sync the clipboards of your devices so that you can copy something on one device and paste the same thing on the other device.\nTerminal Commands\nThis is the most powerful feature of KDE Connect and which I love the most. You can set pre configured buttons on your phone with a particular line of command which will be executed on your computer with a single click from your phone. Some of the things you can do are :\n\nShutdown\nRestart\nHibernate\nSleep\nChange Brightness\nLogout\nLock and Unlock Desktop\nOpen applications\nTake screenshots\n\nThe possibilities are endless, you can do anything you can do on a terminal. This feature alone makes KDE connect far superior than any other software.\nBonus Tip :\nYou can easily get the screenshot of your desktop on your phone with a single click of a button on your phone with this command preconfigured on the KDE connect settings.\nFirstly,\nInstall flameshot and timer\nMake a hidden screenshot folder.\nThen, set the following command on the \"run command\" section of KDE connect settings.\n\nflameshot screen -p &lt;Your New Screenshot Folder's Path&gt; &amp;&amp; timer 5 s ~/audio/duck_song.mp3 hide &amp;&amp; mv &lt;Your New Screenshot Folder's Path/*&gt; \n\nNote : Your smartphone should be mounted to the computer via KDE connect.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/kdeconnect/","title":"KDE Connect"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/kiss/":{"body":"\n\nI had forgotten the world.\nDidn't know what's real from fake.\nI trusted all of you.\nNever realizing that it was a mistake.\nI treated you like my soul.\nNot knowing the taste of heartbreak.\nI gave you all of me and more.\nClearly unknown about what was at stake.\nI wanted to see you happy.\nBut, the efforts kept making me weak.\nI listened to all your stories.\nMany nights I didn't sleep.\nI gave you all my secrets.\nOf mistakes made, that I'd rather die with.\nI used to wish that you'd know me.\nBefore knowing that our dream was just a myth.\nI let you rule my mind.\nDidn't suspect a bit, of what was making me sick.\nI didn't care about myself.\nFrom you, I learned what was narcissistic.\nI have finally cracked the code.\nNow I know, that it was all a trick.\nI had never suspected a thing.\nHallucinating to the taste of your lipstick.\n\n\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/kiss/","title":"Kiss"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/lbry/":{"body":"A decentralized platform for content creators.\nLBRY is a new protocol that allows people to build apps on the top of it which then can interact with the contents available on the LBRY network. LBRY allows the creators to set a price for the stream (Like I-tunes) or give out the video for free (like YouTube). You can publish any kind of file such as video, audio, text, documents, etc. It uses Blockchain technology for the creation of databases on the network.\nThe monetization scheme for content on the LBRY protocol is also based on the Blockchain technology developed by the creator of Bitcoin. Unlike YouTube that serves you ads for monetization LBRY lets people themselves interact with the creators by giving them the ability to treat creators in the form of cryptocurrency (LBC) .\nAlmost all the tech giants today are centralized services that sells user's personal information and attention to advertisers. But LBRY is a protocol making it a decentralized option for publishing contents. Since it's decentralized it means that the content and your privacy is owned by you, not the tech giants whose service you use.\nWorkings of Blockchain in LBRY\nBlockchain technology like Bitcoin and LBRY enables people to create databases that no single entity controls.\nWith Bitcoin, when you send money to someone, your computer broadcasts \"hey, the person with this particular private key is sending money to that person over there\" to the network, and the mining algorithm ensures everyone agrees that indeed, you sent that money, so your balance goes down and the recipient's goes up.\nIn LBRY, the same mechanism is used to store an index of what content is available and how to download it, as well as financial transactions (such as tips, and purchases of paid content) using the Bitcoin-like currency LBC (LBRY Credits). When a creator publishes something on LBRY, an entry is made on the LBRY blockchain. You can think of it as an announcement: hey everyone, I've published this file, here's some information about it, and instructions for how to download it from the peer-to-peer network.\nAdvantages\n\nIt's free and open source.\nThere are no ads.\nBased on a secure platform called Blockchain.\nDecentralized\nDirect interaction between fans and creators.\nFlexibility of content and their file types\nFree speech\n\nDisadvantages\n\nUses cryptocurrency as money which is still not available in many countries.\nComparatively slower than centralized platforms.\nLack of popular content creators.\n\nNormally it is used as an alternative to YouTube. And mostly video files are uploaded. There even is a feature to sync videos from your YouTube account to LBRY. You can access the LBRY content via the following apps and websites:\nApps\n\nAndroid : LBRY\nWindows : LBRY Desktop\nMac : LBRY Desktop\nIOS : Odysee\nLBRY\n\nWebsites\nOdysee\nLBRY\nLBRY\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/lbry/","title":"LBRY"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/life-in-a-box/":{"body":"The days are getting weirder. I think that I am living in a 2D world more than in the 3D world. Here, everything is boxes. Square, squircle, rectangle, rounded rectangle and what not. Not that I am living in a high-tech society where everything is managed by glowing square and rectangle boxes but, my interest in tech and keeping up with it as much as I can have enclosed me in these glowing rectangles.\nWhat is the first thing you do when you wake up in the morning? Drink water? Go to the bathroom? Let me tell you what I am doing. I search for my phone as soon as my eyes are opened in the morning. That is pretty messed up. These boxes have become so involved in my life that I can sense that I am not carrying one around. It feels like I have forgotten to drink water or something similar.\nDuring high usage these boxes don't have very useful things to offer as well, most of the things are just dopamine inducing content that makes you feel like you have laughed or learned something, but it only lasts until the next video starts. But I still shift from one box to another. From my phone to my laptop and then my TV and back to my phone, my life is roaming around.\nIt is not that it only has negatives, from talking to our loved ones to sharing what you have learned to sharing the thoughts that come to your head, everything is done within the boxes, and it is faster and easier too. Even \"social interaction\" is a term that in lies inside the glowing boxes nowadays. Perhaps too much of anything is always bad, and \"everything\" includes the glowing boxes too.\nBecause of these boxes, apparently the generations are divided by the tech literacy than by time. The behaviors of \"Millennial\" living in a developed country where tech adoption is fast may be similar to the \"Generation Z\" living in a developing country where tech adoption is slow or the family who's tech adoption is slow.\nI am a Gen Z myself. Though, I have grown in the age of iPhone and Facebook. I was only introduced to these after 2013 and so were my parents. This makes me feel too young, but Windows 11 was the OS that I used for the first time in my home computer. Though that was the OS when we bought the laptop after I enabled beta updates as soon as I got it because of the \"techie\" I was, and the second day Linux was my main OS, and it has been the same since then. And since everything I watch and everyone I follow are Millennial Tech Geeks, I have become to be this way.\nThe glowing boxes and keeping up with the latest tech news has made me who I am, but the influence of the people who are privacy focused and whom I follow has made me hesitant about things like \"proprietary software\" and \"big tech\". Though it is a good thing, I hesitate to try out new things as they come out. It's a dilemma that there is so much to learn in the world of boxes, but there is also a happier and healthier world to learn about and live in. Only if there was a way to merge the two, which seems more disastrous as I now think about it.\nSo, how do I manage my life in these glowing boxes and my life outside? No, I am not writing about how I manage my life (lives?). I am asking you. It is a very difficult thing to do as a student with all his resources in the form of videos and PDFs. I conclude that self-control is the most essential skill a human needs, and what I need to do is to develop it anyhow. A simple 'ping' or 'ring' should not make me go and pick up a box to eventually get me to doom-scrolling. How's your life like in a box?\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/life-in-a-box/","title":"Life in a Box"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/life-love-twilight-and-a-butterfly/":{"body":"I've seen life in terms of science. Always tend to prefer science's explanation better than any reasoning one might give to life. Because it makes sense. The relief of knowing the end. Believing in what might happen in the last moments. My preferred answers to all the things is scientific, that gives me the relief that it'll be true most of the time.\nYet science fails sometimes. The tried, and tested methods might not be applicable, something that happens regularly doesn't make it true. Consciously and subconsciously, I am still speaking of what science has proven. It has proven itself to be wrong most of the time. That, something should not be thought as one universal truth, but rather a possible truth for the current instance of time.\nLooking outside the window, hearing the barking dogs, the sky is cloudy and it's mildly raining. The streetlights are glowing everywhere, though it's a moonless night, the world is still bright with life. The world around me is sleeping, it's silent, I can hear each raindrop individually, the insects chirping, the wind and my heartbeat. A mosquito is flying around me, with its own goals, to get food, to get energy, to continue itself and preserve its kind. I have a different goal, to kill the mosquito and sleep well. Life's keeping us both alive and awake in this night when everyone is sleeping and consciously dead. Everything is keeping me awake. Myself, the mosquito, the weather, the light outside my house, my phone and many unknown unknowns.\nI've read self-help books, I've watched a lot of talks about achievements and ideas and life, and I get inspired by it. But it doesn't last long. Newton's first law of motion said, \"An object at rest tends to remain at rest, and a moving object tends to remain in motion in a straight line with constant speed.\" Similarly, I tend to remain in the same state of what I am despite being motivated for some time. This whole analogy is faulty because scientifically an object in motion tends to remain in motion in a straight path, unless an external force acts on it. So, technically the reads and talks should have been impacting the whole trajectory of my life, and I surely can say that It hasn't impacted enough to make a difference. The self-help books truly were written for self-help, their own self, like I am writing this piece right now for myself.\nSometimes, you'll never know the correct answer. It's fine to not know something, it's fine to not know anything but, the realization that you will never know something is devastating. It's the feeling of realization that you will never be able to get the thing you wished for. Life changes stories, one changes dreams, like science changes its truth over time.\nSome sleepless nights can get you what you want, others just take life away a tad faster. This one is the latter, the one that has no meaning, there's no achievement, it's just an unhealthy sleepless night. I need to sleep, I feel like sleeping, sleeping until a new day arrives, a whole new life waiting for me to sleep, so it can get to me even faster.\nPeople have explained life in different ways, how love fills it with joy, how having a friend makes it a lot easier to live, how some achievement may make you want to live a bit more. But I particularly like the way nature has taught us. If you cut the cocoon of a butterfly to let it come out of it easily, giving it love and all the care you could give, it will die, not being able to flap its wings, unable to take a flight, unable to live a life, unable to figure out things, unable to find a way to contribute to the world, unable to find a way to live longer and never getting the chance to bring more life like its own to the world.\nLoving an unborn butterfly is cruel, and loving a flying butterfly is stupid. One can only admire its beauty seeing it roam around the flowers, living dodging and ducking the predators and finding its own world to live, a life it wanted, not a life you wanted it to have, not a life you thought would be better, not a life with you and your unintentionally cruel love.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/life-love-twilight-and-a-butterfly/","title":"Life, Love, Twilight and a Butterfly"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/light-mode/":{"body":"I have been a fan of dark mode for a long time. People including myself are so invested into dark mode that everything whether it supports or not is on the dark scheme, or even worse \"pure black\". Every website turns black no matter what the creator had intended. Every app goes dark forcefully with mismatched buttons and forms but we still use it.\nI have read many articles about people changing their display modes to 'light' and saying that \"dark-mode\" isn't as beneficial as we considered it to be. We all assumed that dark mode reduced the strain in our eyes and also saved battery. I cannot be a 100 percent sure and say that it doesn't.\nI recommend reading the article published by The Nielson Norman Group¹ about dark vs light mode, where they have concluded that using Light mode resulted in better performance than using the dark mode for most people.\nWe humans evolved collecting food/hunting in the daytime and taking rest at night, our eyes are developed to be used in the presence of more light. Eyes in general are supposed to be more functional and useful when more light is present. The pupils in our eyes becomes wide when we are in an environment where there is less light, and they  become narrow where there is more, but the performance of our reading doesn't just depend upon the amount of light passing through our pupil, but also the size of the pupil through which the light passes.\nOur eyes just like the cameras work in the same principle (Actually cameras work in the same principle as our eyes do). If the  aperture of the eyes is larger, the depth of field is shallower as a result it is harder to focus on things, but when our eyes have enough light the pupils shrink making the aperture smaller and eventually increasing the depth of field and making it easier for us to focus.\nIt is not that 'dark-mode' has no advantages. It has! The claim that it saves battery is correct, but only if the technology used in the display is OLED. But most laptops and display people use are IPS/LCD panels, which cannot turn off the pixels to display true black like OLED does. There is always a backlit besides the screen which glows when the screen is on even when the colour displayed is black. Dark mode may even be better for people with cloudy ocular media (like cataract) because the display emits less light as the people suffering from this problem prefer less light as more light reaches the eye with a cloudy lens, there’s a bigger chance of a distortion.\nLight mode isn't perfectly good either, because there may be long-term effects associated with light mode, like the chances of myopia.\n\nIn their study, Andrea Aleman and her colleagues at University of Tübingen in Germany asked 7 human participants to read text presented in dark mode and light mode for an hour each. To see if their predisposition to myopia changed after reading, they measured the thickness of the choroid, a vascular membrane behind the retina. The thinning of the choroid is associated with myopia.\n\nConclusion\nLight mode helps us focus better and also reduces strain in our eyes as compared to dark mode, automatically improving our performance and hence our productivity. But in the long term, there might me chances of myopia. Another thing is that dark mode is still required for the people who still enjoy dark mode and also for the people who are suffering from cloudy ocular media or similar problems.\nAs of me, I will be continuing the experiment and keep changing things and try different shades of colours keeping the light theme in mind. I am a person who loves the terminal, so the terminal in light mode is going to be very difficult to adapt, but let's see where this experiment takes me.\nLinks:\nArticle published by The Nielson Norman Group\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/light-mode/","title":"Using Light Mode"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/linux/":{"body":"An open source alternative to Windows and Mac OS.\nLinux is a kernel developed by Linus Torvalds on September 17, 1991. GNU is the core utils of the operating system developed by Richard Stallman on September 27, 1983. Linux provides the kernel , which is the main connector between a hardware and a software and GNU provides the system utilities making GNU/Linux a complete operating system. GNU/Linux is commonly known as Linux Operating System.\nAdvantages\nFree and Open Source\nLinux is completely free in both ways; free as in 'money' as well as free as in 'freedom'. You can do whatever you want to the operating system and it doesn't make you pay for using it unlike Microsoft's Windows.\nCustomization\nSince you can see the whole source code of this OS you can swap out anything with anything. You can even change the desktop environment, window managers, display managers, init system etc which seem like core parts of the OS if you compare it with windows.\nImmune to Viruses\nThere are thousands of people watching the source code of linux, if one person tries to inject a virus or malware to the system , ten other people are there to remove it.\nLight and Fast\nLinux is the fastest operating system in the world, you can make it run very less background processes as per your need and use a very little RAM for system and leave remaining ram to be used by additional applications making it even lighter and faster.\nPrivacy Respecting\nThere is no telemetry enabled on any linux operating systems. If you want you can agree to send some data to them but it is turned off by default, unlike windows where each of their app have telemetry enabled by default.\nBy the People, For the People\nThere is no headquarter of linux, it's a community based OS which is improved and updated by communities if people. So no one needs to worry about sending your data to a giant data hogging company.\nCompatibility\nLinux is compatible with almost every kind of hardware, it can be designed to run on the servers, it can be designed to run on a supercomputer, a desktop, a laptop, a smartphone, a TV etc. Linux can literally run on a toaster.\nPackage Manager\nThe package manager on Linux is the best of it's kind. You type simple command ( eg : apt install  ) on the terminal and \"boom!\" you got the app on your desktop. You can even update your whole system without needing to restart the machine, with a single command.\nVersatility\nLinux is very versatile, it comes in hundreds of flavors. These flavors are called 'distributions'. Distributions are based on different aspects, users, stability, updates, etc. You can choose to use a very stable Linux Distribution or you can choose to use a very updated Distribution. You can choose to use a user friendly Distribution as well as you can choose to just use the TUI without the GUI.\nFOSS\nLinux usually uses FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) which is usually free to use and gets your job done unlike windows where you pay for most of the softwares to work as well as don't know what's going on under the hood because you cannot see the source code.\nDisadvantages\nFragmentation\nOne of the main feature of Linux is also it's disadvantage. The packaging system on Linux is different depending upon the distributions. Which requires the developers to port different types of packages for different distributions despite of being the same operating system.\nCommunity\nSometimes the Linux community is a very helpful place where people can share ideas and problems which they solve as a team but sometimes The Linux community is one of the toxic places for people who are beginners. Most people assume themselves as superior because they use linux and refuse to help since they didn't get any help when \"they\" learnt linux .\nExcessive Choices\nThere are so many choices that a beginner gets overwhelmed with the options. The excess choice in everything also causes fear in the newcomer's heart if they think they chose the wrong option.\nLack of Some Professional Softwares\nMany professional softwares like Adobe Softwares, Microsoft Office, etc are not available in Linux. This can be a huge disadvantage if the user's work totally depends upon these kinds of software.\nPower Management\nLinux on laptops is a bit tricky because it uses a lot of power when installed draining the battery a lot faster than other operating systems. It doesn't have a power saving algorithm like windows or mac does. But this issue can be somewhat fixed by installing additional battery saving softwares especially designed for laptops.\nMy Thoughts\nI personally use and enjoy Linux as my daily driver. It is very fast compared to the windows operating system and I can do any kind of work from semi professional video editing on kdenlive to a simple note writing on kate on Linux. Sometimes there are bugs here and there but if everything was perfect where would be the room for development ? And finally , I use Arch BTW.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/linux/","title":"Linux"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/love-of-my-life/":{"body":"Those few moments before disasters,\nMoments of breakups and pain,\nMoments of failures and pain,\nMoments of stress and pain,\nMoments of rejections and pain,\nAhh pain!\nMy one true friend, my love.\nThe one who never leaves me.\nThe one and the only!\nI love the constant breaks and patches.\nI love how you surprise me.\nI love the things you do to me.\nYeah!

This is what it takes to be heard in the internet.\n\nIn our rapidly evolving world, the concepts of feminism and patriarchy have become increasingly polarizing topics. However, it's crucial to consider the existence of alternative perspectives, such as masculism and matriarchy, which offer equally valid viewpoints in this context. As a humanist, I believe that men and women should view each other as complementary pieces of a whole, functioning together, kinda like plants which have both male and female organs in the same body.\nThe natural differences between male and female in humans are not as extreme as in some species, where male bees die after mating or female spiders are consumed by their offspring. While individual humans have unique personalities, strengths, and weaknesses, neither males nor females are complete without the other. Historically, we have coexisted for the sake of offspring and family.\nIt's important to recognize that traditional gender roles, where females solely care for children and males exclusively work or hunt, are not the only viable arrangement. Both caring for children and earning a living are equally necessary, and these responsibilities should be shared based on individual abilities and circumstances. Suppressing one gender from their potential is counterproductive; instead, we should foster understanding between partners and organize our efforts intellectually to create a balanced approach to living, caring, and raising offspring.\nMy analysis of internet content, particularly on platforms like YouTube, reveals a troubling trend. As a male, I've noticed that I'm often exposed to male-oriented content, which can lead to increasingly extremist views portraying men as \"right\" and women as trying to \"win at everything.\" Conversely, women may be exposed to equally polarizing content depicting men as oppressors, killers, and rapists. This divisive approach creates an \"us vs. them\" mentality, where each side views the other through an extremist lens.\nThe media's focus on controversial and extreme content, driven by the pursuit of attention and profit, has contributed to this polarization. However, I believe that no sane, educated person is inherently an oppressor or oppressed in a relationship. Most reasonable men support equal rights and opportunities for women. Labeling entire groups as weak or strong is unscientific and counterproductive.\nAs humans, we have achieved remarkable technological and scientific advancements through proper planning and reasoning. It's essential to question outdated ways of thinking and embrace new truths as they emerge. Prioritizing one gender over another in the name of culture, especially when scientific evidence contradicts such practices, hinders human progress.\nHowever, it's also important to recognize that new ways of thinking aren't always entirely correct. For instance, pornography, while introducing many people to sex and reproduction, has created unrealistic expectations and unhealthy influences on relationships where people are no longer being stimulated by \"normal\" and getting into extremes which might have caused in an increase in rape and child abuse cases. Similarly, social media has fostered insecurities about lifestyle, body image, and personal appearance by presenting an idealized version of life that makes people feel inadequate and might be the cause of depression and anxiety feeling worthless and never enough.\n\nThat being said the causes of child abuse, rape cases and an existance of countless supressed voices of victims isn't only by extreme porn but also a sense of authority of some males in the society who actually are opressors and think they can get away with anything or the arrogant confidence that \"nobody will believe\" they have done such things.\n\n\nI once had asked my friend about what could have caused these cases where men get away of doing such cruel deeds and she said, \"Our society is largely run by men. Most positions of power – be it in government, corporations, or law enforcement – are occupied by men. This creates a system where men in authority might be inclined to protect other men accused of wrongdoing. They may downplay the severity of crimes, question the credibility of victims, or find ways to shift blame onto the affected parties. This pattern often leads to a conclusion that somehow excuses the perpetrator or suggests the victim is partially responsible for what happened to them.\" which I think is true.\n\nI long for a society that supports and uplifts everyone, regardless of gender, physiology, or biology. A culture where people help each other overcome weaknesses instead of using them as grounds for oppression. By working together, we can solve problems that we as individuals cannot tackle alone and for that we have to remove the extreme categorization of people soley based on sex or race. Because in the world where no two people are alike I don't think that categorization solves any issue.\n\nPerhaps reality is more neutral, and I dont know what I am talking about because the internet is where I live and I consume what it offers. I just hope that we are heading toward a better future where the differences of people isn't a problem but our strength.\n\nLastly...\nI was very scared to publish this in the internet, but, it's crucial to address these complex societal issues. They don't have easy solutions, but open dialogue is a vital step towards understanding the world we inhabit.\nThis post is just the beginning of a larger conversation. I eagerly anticipate your responses and insights, as I recognize there's still much for me to learn.\nAdditions\n\n2024-09-18\nI decided to use the word \"humanist\" as a more neutral term to address similar values to feminism aiming to avoid the negative connotations some people associate with the word \"feminist\". The word \"humanist\" respects the feminist thought because it aligns with the feminist principles and by no means shadows the historical as well as ongoing struggles for women's rights. Feminism is in no way about female superiority or harming men, and to be a humanist is also being feminist without the mentioned wrong perspective of society and in general the male population.\nIt is catered toward a male population who would hesitate to talk about feminism due to the polarization of the topic by the mass media. Understanding the values of \"humanism\" and providing the information that humanism is in fact feminism just hiding behind a curtain of insecurity of being misjudged for the looks and the negative protrayal.\n\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/masculism-and-feminism/","title":"Masculism v/s Matriarchy"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/mastodon/":{"body":"A Secure Decentralized Social Network.\nMastodon is a federated social media platform ( Actually a microblogging platform similar to Twitter ) based on a communication protocol called Activity Pub. It was released on 16th March 2016 and was created to be a safe place to share Ideas between people without having to trust a single organization for all your data. It is a free and open source software and can be used to self host social networking service so that you have the option to keep your data with you or with whom you trust.\n\nFederation\n\nThe greatest feature of mastodon is it's federated nature. Mastodon doesn't have a single server that store and moderates the data coming in and going out from it unlike Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or any other centralized platforms have. Which gives you the option to choose who to trust with your data and why.\n\nInstances\n\nMastodon has many servers with their own moderator(s) all around the globe hosted by different organizations with different mindset and different regulations. These servers are known as Instances which can be categorised by the topics,places, ethnicity, etc. So they don't have a single set of rules and regulations but have different rules on different instances making communication between known and unknown communities easier.\n\nModeration\n\nDifferent instances have different populations and are moderated by different moderators which makes it easier to reach the users and respond to their issue. If a instance has 1000 peoples and two moderators, a moderators should only have to moderate 500 peoples, since the moderators are also the active members of the community who constantly interact with what is happening in the community they can solve the issues of the users in a more systematic and timely manner. On the other hand Twitter like platforms mostly use AI to moderate and the issues might take days or even weeks to get responded. There are times when people are responded for their issues by their moderators within minutes in mastodon.\n\nCommunication\n\nSince it is based on Activity Pub anyone can communicate with anyone on the other instance or even with other platforms like pleroma and peertube( based on Activity Pub ) from a single mastodon account without having to make different accounts for different platforms in order to communicate with the people in that platform ( Like you need a seperate accounts to follow users in different platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube ,etc. )\n\nFlexibility\n\nMastodon includes a number of specific privacy features. Each message has a variety of privacy options available, and users can choose whether the message is public or private. Public messages display on a global feed, known as a timeline, and private messages are only shared on the timelines of the user's followers. Messages can also be marked as unlisted from timelines or direct between users. Users can also mark their accounts as completely private. In the timeline, polls can also be made and you can also create messages that can be displayed with an optional \"content warning\" feature, which requires readers to click on the content to reveal the rest of the message. Mastodon servers have used this feature to hide spoilers, trigger warnings, and not safe for work (NSFW) content, though some accounts use the feature to hide links and thoughts others might not want to read.\nCheck out my article on fediverse for more details.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/mastodon/","title":"Mastodon"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/matrix/":{"body":"An open network for secure, decentralized communication\n\nMatrix is an open source project that publishes the Matrix open standard for secure, decentralized, real-time communication, and its Apache licensed reference implementations.\nIt gives you simple HTTP APIs and SDKs to create chatrooms, direct chats and chat bots, complete with end-to-end encryption, file transfer, synchronised conversation history, formatted messages, read receipts and more .\nAdvantages\nEnd To End Encryption\nNormally the messages on matrix are end to end encrypted, meaning they can only be read by the recipients with the correct set of keys.\nBridges\nMatrix can integrate with other chat services like IRC, Telegram, Discord etc by the means of bridges. With bridges you can send messages to a telegram group bridged to matrix and they can see and reply back easily.\nDecentralized\nMatrix has no specific server nor it has a specific app. It is decentralized which makes it safer than the centralized messaging services offered by giant data hogging companies like Facebook, Discord, etc.\nVoIP\nMatrix offers VoIP service which means that you can make high quality audio and video calls over the internet and still using an open source and decentralized platform.\nUser Centric\nMatrix can offer what the user want. If you want unencrypted messages? You can. If you want a different server? You can. If you want a different application? You can. You have the ability to make your own server, even design a whole application if you can, the possibilities are endless.\nDisadvantages\nDifficult to Understand\nThe concept of Decentralization, Federation and Multiple servers can be a bit difficult to handle by a normal brain, especially if they haven't heard about it before. Also the encryption on matrix is very good which takes us to a famous saying, \"Privacy comes with a cost of convenience.\". Since every client should be verified with backup keys or use another login to to verify the new one, it becomes a bit difficult than other services like Facebook , Discord which just need you to input your ID and password to login and see all the chats.\nUncertainty of Servers\nServers are the places where you have your account and where you communicate from. It's like a village where you live, but the servers can go out of fund or the administrator may lose interest and \"Your village may get destructed.\"\nLack of Users\nMost of the people that use matrix are tech enthusiasts, open source supporters, privacy enthusiasts, and other people (ahmm ! Basically Nerds!). You might not find the people whom you usually talk to in Matrix.\nOverall Matrix is very good alternative to other chat services like telegram, signal, messenger, etc. It is very flexible as well as secure which makes it better than all others. And since it's a developing project there are much more features to come. Different clients also are developing \"default\" features of messaging apps like voice message and other features making easier for the people to shift from their existing platform too if you feel like switching.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/matrix/","title":"Matrix"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/midnight/":{"body":"It's midnight!\nOnly light is that of the moon,\nonly light that I trust won't go.\nOnly thoughts are that of yours,\nonly thoughts that can not go.\nGone would be my sight all night,\nif the moon, was gone, forever.\nGone would be my hope for life,\nif those thoughts, could disappear.\nI'm awake all night when you're there,\nbecause, you're awake, night matters.\nI'm always there, the one for you,\nbecause, for me, it's you that matters.\nI'd rather sleep waiting for you to call,\nand dream about, our beautiful world.\nI'm your's for eternity and a little more,\nand I'll be with you, forever entangled.\nIt's almost one and the night's darker,\nand yet my eyes, are full of your smile.\nStormy sky and the lights are off now,\nand yet my words, won't stop for a while.\nThe more I write the less I know that,\nit's not enough, I should write better.\nIt's never enough for me to write you,\nI'm writing you one and I'll send it later.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/midnight/","title":"Midnight"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/missed/":{"body":"What have I done for you?\nDo I expect some things?\nI've always been there, your shadow.\nPushing limits, the poem sings.\nWhy do I feel not included?\nDo you see me as a stranger?\nI've been there with you all the time.\nYet I'm alone, it's all stranger danger.\nSeeing you, I think it's love.\nThings I'd do to make you smile.\nAnd yet you've lost me here.\nI see you found your style.\nExpectations, they are gone now.\nI think, I am done here.\nIgnoring you would be so great.\nYou don't know what love is, dear.\nI've lost people this way.\nOne person at a time.\nNow I feel how my mom felt.\nI've been too kind, I'm fine.\nBlind spots, though, you see things.\nI was always in your side.\nSome sides you don't notice.\nThough, you notice far and wide.\nI don't care what you saw.\nI always did my part there.\nYou should have seen me do it.\nMy spectra were loud and clear.\nNow I think why I did it.\nShould not have pushed the bounds.\nNow, every time it scares me.\nYour eyes, the face, those sounds.\nThink I'll stop what I did.\nBut others deserve the same.\nSo, I'll behave the same way.\nUntil I finish crossing their name.\nI don't feel missed by you.\nBecause feelings can be false.\nBut the proof doesn't lie me.\nYou missed me, middle of the alls.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/missed/","title":"Missed"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/monopoly/":{"body":"A brief introduction to strategy of big tech companies.\nEverything in this world requires competition and challenges  so that it could evolve. So if there is nobody to compete with, there cannot be development. This is a serious issue in today's tech world where tech giants like Google, Facebook, Microsoft have gained total monopoly in their fields.\nStarting with google, the operating system you use which is android is Google's product (Though the actual operating system is open source the services built on top of it are mostly made by google and are closed source.) ,the phone app you're using is from google, the photos app , YouTube, Calendar, Email, Maps, Podcasts, Assistant etc. are Google's products but no one searches alternative for  because they are interconnected among themselves. If you just delete your email account your photos backed up in the cloud , your youtube libraries , your location history and addresses ,your browsing history, bookmarks, your phone book, the services logged in with google, everything will be deleted so, you will not be able to (and will not even consider to)  get out of it's system.\nNow, lets look at Facebook (Now known as Meta). Everybody uses facebook but no one knowns that there exists platform mastodon, disapora , friendrica, etc which has the same objective as Facebook's. But facebook being a big company knows what to do to not let people escape from their own ecosystem. They saw Instagram as a competition but instead of competing with it they decided to buy it. Now, everybody who were in instagram got connected to facebook services. Similarly , they purchased WhatsApp because it felt like a threat to their own facebook messenger. If they couldn't buy it, they take the main feature of that particular apps and add them to their own. They brought the stories feature and the disappearing messages feature from snapchat, twitter had a heart button they brought a whole range of buttons with different emojis on it saying it's a react button They also bought Oculus which was a company  developing virtual reality headsets. As of now, the only way to log in to the headset is by using a facebook account. You can sign-up for a different thing like pinterest (For example) via your facebook account which seems like a easy way but it's not. Because if you somehow lose your facebook account ,now a totally different platform is out of access because it used facebook to log you in.\nTalking about Microsoft they are the king in the space of desktop computer operating system. Almost every apps are made for windows, their office suite \"the Microsoft office suite \" or \"Office 365\" has become the only office suite that is used by almost everyone even if there exist other suites like only office, libre office, etc. They have their own extensions for files .pptx , .docs, .xls etc which is used by almost every office computer in the planet where the .odf (Open Document Format) which is an open source document format doesn't play well with their office suite so the people using MS office will keep using the same office and doesn't leave them. The OS itself comes pre-installed on computers so no normie would ever change the OS instead they will just keep using what they got i.e. microsoft.\nThis is just a tip of an iceberg and there is a lot more in this topic. This behavior of big tech companies completely destroys the competition on the market because there remains nothing to compete with when they are the only one providing that service.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/monopoly/","title":"Monopoly"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/moonshine/":{"body":"I compare you to the moon in the sky,\nyou're different each day, like lua's phases,\nthe craters I see, are your subtle dimples,\nyour shiny eyes, the moon glowing bright.\nI compare you with the daisy in the wild,\nyou smile for no reason, like daisies bloom,\ntheir dance with wind, is you being yourself,\nyour simple heart, it's what they represent.\nI compare you to the poems that I write,\nyou're the only one, like the rhymes I rhyme,\nworlds they contain, are your favorite places,\nyour cute smile, is what they always seek.\nI compare you with me and my nuances,\nyou complete me, just like I want you to do,\nmy weird views, are like \"em\" trends you follow,\nyou yourself, is who I'm entangled with.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/moonshine/","title":"Moonshine"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/multiple-faces/":{"body":"This one is for you.

Binaries can be used for standard components, and custom-built packages and modules can be used automatically when a pre-built binary is not available.\n\n\nNixOS Commands\nNormal\n\n\nnixos-rebuild is a command to rebuild the entire system according to the declarations in /etc/nixos/configuration.nix . It consists of many flags like switch,boot,--flakes etc to specify the rebuild method.\n\n\nnix-collect-garbage is a tool to clear the garbage packages (the packages which were installed during a rebuild but now are not needed for the smooth functioning of the system as per the declarations), it comes handy to clear the previous generations which are not required anymore to fallback on.\n\n\nImperative Operations\n\n\nnix-shell is a (legacy) tool to spawn temporary virtual environments with packages that are not in the system. You can use nix-shell -p git you'll be dropped into a nix-shell environment where you can use the git command and if you exit the shell the environment will be lost.\n\n\nnix-env a (legacy) tool to use nix package manager in an imperative style similar to other linux distributions. You can use nix-env -iA pkgs.firefox to install firefox and keep the changes in a stateful manner.\n\n\nnix-channel a (legacy) tool to manage channels (similar to repositories), it allows to do things like changing the version of the channel that the package manager will pull from. For eg: If you want to use the latest unstable branch but you are running a stable release version of system (22.04 or similar) you can change it by using the nix-channel.\n\n\nFlakes (Experimental Features)\nThis is a feature of nix that improves reproducibility, composability and usability in the Nix ecosystem.

There are different kinds of sleeping habits where the most followed schedule specially in my country and also in the whole world is the monophasic sleep.\nWe usually sleep at night and work in the day in big chunks. Humans evolved as a diurnal (active during the day) species; we don’t see especially well during the night, and the hunting method that helped early humans catch large prey, which saw groups track them to exhaustion, works best if you can see where you’re going. It is safe to say that it's an evolutionary advantage, or is it?\nI got interested in polyphasic sleep after the video from No Boilerplate. Though I haven't yet started to implement it. I have been researching about it extensively. I am a student with classes from 10:00 to 17:00 every day excluding Saturday as the weekend. So, my sleeping habits should be managed according to that schedule. And attending club events and working there after the college time, I have to cram in some sleep into the busy schedule.\nWhy ?\nComputer Engineering has been an experience till now. This first year I failed miserably, the two semesters went by so fast, I wasn't able to do much except tinker around with this site and procrastinate by writing poems when I had time. 6 subjects in the first semester and 5 in the second, these were basic subjects but now in the third semester things are not going to be easy as it was before. 7 core subjects in 5 months is not very easy to handle. Especially being the class representative who has to manage class schedules, inform the whole class about notices, maintain the teacher-class relation, be available for almost anything regarding the class anytime and unfortunately should be okay with getting calls from unknown numbers any time of the day, which sometimes gets very frustrating.\nEnough of the rant, I need to manage time, and it should not be like how I did in the first year, It was a mess. I need my working time to be the maximum amount and that means the sleep time should be the minimum healthy amount without it making me sick and unproductive. And I see polyphasic sleep as one of the ways to tackle that problem.\nWhat ?\nPolyphasic sleeping generally tends rely on the observation that our brain only gets about 2 hours of REM in every night of sleep. Hence, the main goal is to fall asleep to the REM phase and not waste time in deep sleep which is the rest of the time spent on sleep. Deep sleep is considered restful for the body but no more than waking forms of rest. Hence, the difficult part is to get to the REM sleep instantly.\nThere are many schedules for polyphasic sleep; biphasic, everyman, dual core, tri core, core only, nap only, flexible and non-reducing. Which have their own benefit and time constrains. Most of these are either very difficult to follow or do not work with my schedule and the schedules like Uberman and Dymaxion are very very difficult to follow but not impossible.\nScientist, artist, engineer, and inventor Leonardo da Vinci, who lived from 1452 to 1519, reportedly used an Uberman schedule to sleep for 20 minutes every four hours. Other engineers and inventors may have applied this unconventional sleep pattern, such as Nikola Tesla, who lived from 1856 to 1943. Though this sleeping schedule never quite took hold among the general public, polyphasic sleep rose in prominence in the 1940s as inventor Buckminster Fuller touted his Dymaxion method, which was four equidistant 30m naps taken every 6 hours, totaling only 2h of sleep a day.\nWhich ?\nAccording to my routine I am leaning toward the Everyman Schedules. Particularly the alternate variant of the Everyman Two Schedule somewhat equidistant which is one of the rarest Everyman Two scheduling options. According to polyphasic.net, The ideas behind this scheduling option are:\n\n\nUse the core as a blanket duration to stay awake until very late morning hours (close to noon/lunch break).\n\n\nOnce adapted, the night will feel much shorter as there is more time awake until almost noon. The core usually starts around midnight or slightly earlier; this trait can resemble certain reduced monophasic lifestyles with a very early morning wake time.\n\n\nThough I can't follow the exact schedule, I am thinking of modifying it in a way that fits with my daily routine.\nModifications ?\nUnmodified Everyman Two: Somewhat Equidistant variant:\n\nMy variant:\n\nSo ?\nAdaptation is the most difficult thing to start anything. There are recommendations to jump start adaptation like; staying awake before starting, naptation and cold turkey. This is just me analyzing the possibilities. I'll write another article about it if I fail or succeed in the adaptation. Until then, goodnight!\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/polyphasic-sleep/","title":"Polyphasic Sleep: Analysis"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/privacy/":{"body":"A Concept Extinct A Long Time Ago ( A living Myth )\nIf you think you are private and secure then think again.

Trust me it isn't coincidence.\nGoogle employees can even access users' email to delete virus', or remove potentially unsafe or violent emails. Emails are considered as one of the most private medium of communicating. Guess what, Google employees can access that without a warrant. All comes down to that one part where you have signed the agreement clause when you created your account.\nOn his blog by David Evenden he says, \" I would nearly guarantee all email vendors are the same way.

It effectively transforms the port-forwarded computer into a server by linking it to the broader intranet, allowing seamless communication between internal and external networks.\nWhen configuring port forwarding, you reserve a specific port number on the gateway exclusively for communication with a service located on a specific host within the private network. To interact with the network-internal service from outside the local network, it's essential to know this designated port number and the gateway's address.\nThe applications of port forwarding are diverse and vital for various purposes, including but not limited to:\n\nRunning a public HTTP server, enabling the hosting of websites accessible from the internet.\nPermitting Secure Shell (SSH) access to a host, facilitating secure remote management and access to the system.\nAllowing FTP access to a host, simplifying file transfers between systems.\nRunning a publicly available game server, enabling multiplayer gaming experiences across the web.\n\nHow to port forward?\nTo set up port forwarding correctly, follow these steps:\n\nConfigure a static IP address for the device you wish to forward ports to. Dynamic IP addresses may cause connectivity issues after router restarts.\nLog into your router's administration panel and navigate to the port forwarding section.\nEnter the specific port numbers you want to forward, along with the static IP address of the target device.\nChoose the appropriate forwarding protocol (TCP, UDP, or both) based on the requirements of the service.\nSave the changes to apply the port forwarding settings.\n\nHow does it work?\nPort forwarding operates on the distinction between public and private IP addresses. A public IP address allows you to send and receive data from anywhere on the internet, while a private IP address restricts data exchange to your local network only.\nSending Data\nWhen your device sends data packets, they are received by the router, which identifies the data as destined for a port-forwarded device. The router then forwards the data packet to the public IP address, making it accessible from anywhere on the internet.\nReceiving Data\nConversely, when a remote device sends data to your public IP address, the router intercepts the data packet and forwards it to the specific port-forwarded device within your local network, ensuring seamless receipt of the data.\nWhy port forward?\nPort forwarding is essential for several reasons:\n\nRemote Access: It enables remote access to services and devices within a private network, facilitating tasks like remote management, file access, and more.\nHosting Services: Port forwarding allows hosting servers for websites, games, and other applications, making them accessible to users over the internet.\nOptimizing Connectivity: By forwarding specific ports for particular services, you can improve connectivity and reduce network congestion, leading to better performance.\n\nIn summary, port forwarding is a powerful tool that enhances network capabilities, facilitates seamless communication between private and public networks, and empowers users to host various services and applications with ease.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/rasp-sshforewarding/","title":"Forwarding Ports"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/relative-happiness/":{"body":"Happiness can be faked, I guess. Because, It means two things. The happiness that you think that you feel, and the happiness that others think that you feel. And yeah, It is easy to say, \"If you're not happy, just be happy!\" to a person when you in your mind think that you are happy yourself. When you are happy, it is easy to assume that others are happy too (or others can be happy too). But as all things science, everything that you see or feel isn't true. It is more difficult to believe if someone is happy if you yourself do think that you are not happy. Speaking as a person who used this (\"If you're not happy, just be happy!\") Sentence quite often (well I am a professional here, having experienced both happiness and unhappiness), I genuinely believed that you can just think that you're happy, then bam! You'll be happy.\nBut, apparently it is far difficult to \"fake happiness until you make happiness\" when you are in a state of \"unhappiness\" yourself. That makes me think that there are two kinds of happiness. One will be the temporary (at the moment) happiness, and another will be persistent (most of the time) happiness. You seem to be feeling happy when you do something that makes you happy (like, watching a movie or writing whatever you want and calling it a story when it clearly isn't) which is the temporary happiness. And the persistent happiness or unhappiness in this case is that constant reminder of your brain calling a moment happy because every other moment other than that moment means not being happy.\n(Ooh! Chest pains!) Yeah, it is complex when you really think about it, but when you're really happy you don't think about being happy. Well, this mild surge of unhappiness that I am feeling might have caused by me not being able to reach their expectations or they not being to reach my expectations or both or none(because I think I am forcing myself to be happy for a million reasons to be happy but failing to be happy, hence this \"story\"). But, see? The main source of happiness is unhappiness itself (bravo! Consolidating yourself!) and well if you're unhappy now, you are destined to be happy after this session of unhappiness ends (hah! The path to happiness).\nSo, since you have read till the end, you might have grasped the very concept of happiness (or unhappiness), but (hahaha \"butt\") if you by any means take this seriously and somehow got into an unending rabbithole of unhappiness (or happiness (equally dangerous (haha brackets inside brackets inside brackets (parenthesis?))) ) that is not to be blamed to me.

Whether it is about the weather, new music, local news, or a new posting from a rarely-updated site, learn you get as soon as it is published.\nYou can save a lot of time by reading a self curated feed instead of browsing all the websites one by one.\nUnlike emails, you can easily subscribe and unsubscribe whenever you want.\nYou won't be spammed with useless information, unlike emails where you might get every kind of spam and non-informative emails after they get your email.\nThe feed you get is organized in a chronological order, and you can keep track if it is already read or not.\nRSS doesn't have ads and trackers that you find on a website, which is good for your reading experience as well as your privacy.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nArticles (Info) from the sites is received in a certain amount instead of the whole article, so you are very likely to go inside the webpage instead of just reading the RSS content.\nIt is very difficult to accurately track the number of subscribers who read an RSS feed or the items contained in an RSS feed.\nRSS readers load up different websites at once and since most RSS contents doesn't contain full articles you also go to their website, increasing the data traffic.\nRSS contents will not be counted as views to the websites, so it could impact on the income of the creator.\n\nRSS is a very old but useful tech. With it being one of the go-to methods of creating feeds, RSS has been implemented in various fields and can fetch different data from different sources. I am personally using RSS to keep track of what my friends are doing on Instagram and Twitter, as well as subscribing to websites as well as YouTube channels I like. These social media don't have RSS integrated with them, but frontends like Bibliogram(Instagram) and Nitter(Twitter) allow you to subscribe to the publicly available profiles with RSS. RSS is a must-have thing if you go to websites frequently to get information.\nLinks :\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/rss/","title":"RSS"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/scared/":{"body":"I'm too scared, and it is not my fault.\nChoosing these words, became difficult.\nMinor details, I've begun to care for.\nNever satisfied, wish I'd be there more.\nI feel disabled, to be there for you.\nBehind screens, pretending to care you.\nI think about it a lot, before I say.\nAll possibilities and the correct way.\nMy thoughts, they conquer all my time.\nPresent, old past, new future of mine.\nRight answers, I've been searching for.\nWhat I am searching is wrong, I fear.\nI say things, and think that I mean it.\nThey just remain words, out of my limits.\nThe future, possibilities of you and me.\nAll gathers inside, into scary feelings.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/scared/","title":"Scared"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/search-engines/":{"body":"Finding things in the web.\n\nSearch engines are software that search the things you want in the vast web and shows relevant information to you.

Because I am a pretty chill guy, my sadness lasts for a very short time. It might be because I have very fewer responsibilities and don't have to do much work. I don't know how it actually feels like, maybe I haven't experienced something they have experienced. I see people stressing out and wonder why they don't be \"just happy\". It sounds dumb, but that's what I feel, why wouldn't they just feel happy about what they are doing. I know that It's like telling a person with depression to just be happy. But actually that is the feeling I get when I see these people. It's totally fine to be sad, I am an adult and I do cry sometimes, but that doesn't mean that I am sad all the time. Or even if I am feeling bad I smile, and after a while it goes away. If there's no need to look sad (like, in a funeral or anything else.) I just like to handle the situations smiling or even giggling. That has its own benefits, but a huge negative is that it makes you a little \"not serious\". I have experienced this a lot, mostly when I am giving a suggestion and my friends doesn't give a damn about it. Is it really necessary to be bold every time and say the things you want to say in a so called \"serious\" manner? I usually don't talk in groups but a single person  and I do try to make attempts to make the other laugh in a conversation, but that's everyone I guess, because who would really like to be very serious in a conversation. There's a huge role of a person's expressions in a conversation. If the speaker is smiling and talking, the listener will definitely smile despite the pain inside them, the person will feel fresh after taking with you even if they were sad. If you're feeling angry, and you talk with someone in an angry manner, you will get the same expression from them because that's how it works. A simple smile can determine the day of that person you were just talking to. Now that I think of it, it feels more simple. It's like Newton's third law of 'motion', but with an \"e\" on the front. If you smile they will smile back, if you are angry they get angry back at you, if you help they will help you back, if you are sad they will feel the same (though it's not the same thing that you're experiencing, but they do).\nIt's funny how people don't realize that they both are angry and arguing with each other because one person was a little angry which started a chain reaction on their anger now they both are fighting. I am not funny nor am I very handsome and charming, but a smile is all it takes to make a person next to you feel happy, and I do smile.\nThat's all for today, keep smiling.\nBe Happy\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/smile/","title":"Sad? Just Smile!"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/some-thoughts-on-privacy/":{"body":"\nand also on privacy respecting media.\n\n\nThese are my views on this topic so, a reply with a correction or your view would be highly appreciated.\nFor a different perspective on this topic, check the end of this article.\n\nMy Experience\nI encountered what privacy is by coming to Linux and interacting with the people of the FOSS community. And It has taught me things that I would not have learned anywhere else. But when it comes to why we need privacy, and why losing some comfort is worth it, I quite can't teach or make it clear to people. I follow the practice to be private on the internet mostly because I agree with the people from the community. I learned about the Gemini protocol, the Fediverse, the Matrix protocol, self-hosting and many more concepts because of the community.\nNot using Facebook and mainstream social media like Instagram, Twitter, etc has surely changed the way I think about people and the internet but it also has broken my contact with my family and relatives. I asked the ones who wanted to contact me to install \"Signal\" and to contact me there since it was the easiest to set up and use for everyone. Though it isn't a perfect replacement for a \"social media\" like Facebook it has done the job for the most part, at least has fulfilled my basic social interactions.\nHere are my thoughts on the positives and as well as the negatives of maintaining/trying to maintain privacy:\nThe Positives\nJudgements\nIt is an undeniable fact that we judge a person firstly by how they look. If they look clean, wear attractive clothes, has big eyes we seem to make our mind up that they are the kind of friends we want and if anyone has a darker skin color, is wearing oversized clothes, or has imperfections on their face we tend to be far from them. Being and interacting with \"anonymous\" people on the internet has made me think about our prejudice toward people. Nobody has judged me and I haven't judged anyone but have helped each other regardless of how we look (here on the platforms like mastodon(Fosstodon), Gemini(Station and Geminiverse)). So, one aspect of privacy on the internet that I like is that it minimizes prejudice.\nSafety\nMaintaining privacy and not disclosing the location of where we live, who our relatives are, where we work and many similar \"Oh! it doesn't matter.\" things will make us safe from the people who \"hate\" us or our views and may bring threat to us. It creates a virtual chamber where we can settle disputes without physical contact and gives everyone enough time to think and argue about their view.\nTunneled Vision\nThe internet has lost its position from the place where we gain information about a vast range of topics to the place which agrees with what you like and nothing else. These algorithms in our media collect information about us and feed us what we have an interest in, which may seem to be a very good thing when we look straight into it but behind it, it's not something made for our comfort but for them to increase our watch time in those media and show us as many ads as possible which also are shown based on our interests making us their product to the ad distributors. So, being private and not letting these media collect media helps us to not get distracted by ads and not get tunneled to a certain view as it won't just show what we prefer but also shows us multiple perspectives.\nFocus\nNot having to care about maintaining an image in the media and being seen as equal by everyone else and treated like everyone else removes many burdens from the mind and helps focus on the subject matter and views instead of branching focus to other unnecessary variables helps (at least for me) to be more productive.\nExpectations and Mental Health\nBeing private on the internet also demands similar people and media thus taking away the people that may create a sense of insecurity, like having expectations of being a celebrity or being \"socially accepted beautiful\", getting celebrity worship syndrome, expectation for filmy love or romance. Since everything on the internet is not true and mostly tampered with to make it look \"good\", being private on the internet and using media that respects ones privacy helps a lot in preventing psychological health issues, especially for teens.\nMore:\n\nDecrease in chances of scams and spam,\nProtection from identity theft,\nOffers freedom to express oneself, and much more that I cannot think of.\n\nThe Negatives\nFame and Recognition\nWe need fame and recognition to be respected in human society and being famous on the internet has become our priority but internet privacy and fame might not go together so, complete privacy isn't possible. A well thought privacy threat model should be implemented never-the-less to mitigate the threats instead of completely giving up on internet privacy because having fame adds more threats as well as responsibilities.\nConnection and Contacts\nLosing contact with relatives, friends and family trying to give priority to privacy is one of the most experienced downsides of it. Not everybody understands or cares about privacy and leaving centralized privacy disrespecting monopoly leads to losing contact with people you were in contact with yesterday. Using workarounds to access those media may mitigate the issue but is not a complete solution.\nInformation Distribution\nWe have to get local news and information distributed by collage and clubs or the organizations where we work, which mostly are circulated exclusively on the centralized privacy disrespecting monopoly media. This centralized locking of information has been one of the barriers to freedom and internet privacy as well.\nMore:\n\nBeing an outcast from a circle,\nA hassle to manage and keep track of,\nPeople try more to exploit you the more you try to be private, and unfortunately, the negatives too don't end here.\n\n\nPrivacy in itself is a very broad subject to be discussed. A single person's view isn't sufficient on what privacy is and what isn't so I expect some flaws in my writing if seen from a different perspective. So, I thought of accumulating everyone's view on it. I also request you include a list of authors and their articles related to mine at the bottom of your reply/article as I have done below.

It could be minimal for some people, but having a working smartphone\nand a pretty good laptop isn't minimal, judging by the plethora of things I can do within these devices.\nA huge chunk of my personality is influenced by Linux and the principles/philosophies I have learned to interact with the\nLinux and Open Source ecosystem. KISS, UNIX, DRY, YAGNI, etc. These are some of the things I have been exposed to\nfor too many times. I see that they all have one thing in common; Minimalism.\nWhat are thoseeeee?\nLet's start with KISS because I like the sound of it,\nKISS\nKeep It Simple Stupid or one of the variations below implies that simplicity should be a design goal.\n\nVariations\n\nKeep It Super Simple\nKeep It Simple, Silly\nKeep It Short and Simple\nKeep It Short and Sweet\nKeep It Simple and Straightforward\nKeep It Small and Simple\nKeep It Simple, Sweetie\nKeep It Stupidly Simple\nKeep It Sweet and Simple\n\n\nUNIX\nUNIX philosophy is a set of norms and philosophical approaches to minimalist, modular software development.\nThe most emphasized concept is,\"Write programs that do one thing and do it well.\"\nDRY\nThe Don't Repeat Yourself principle is stated as \"Every piece of knowledge must have a single,\nunambiguous, authoritative representation within a system\". What I understand by it is that, redundancy\nmakes a system confusing and unintuitive.\nYAGNI\n\"You aren't gonna need it\" or \"You ain't gonna need it\" is something that arose from Doing the simplest\nthing that could possibly work.\netc\n\"End of thinking capacity\" or I don't want to lengthen my blog yapping about acronyms and want to\ncome to the actual topic.\nSo, what did you do?\nI am trying to follow these principles in my daily life and in using tech in general. Partly because I\nwant to live outside these devices more, and mostly because I don't like the \"attention economy\" and big\ntech constantly trying to pull our attention and make us watch more ads. In general, \"I don't want to be\nthe product.\" I guess the reasons for partly and mostly should have been the other way around, but I'll get\nthe same outcome anyway.\nFor starters, I bought a watch, just so that I don't have to keep pulling out my phone and check the time only to see\na notification and get sucked into the rabbit hole. That has made keeping the phone in my bag instead of in my pocket\npossible.\n\nThat's the only thing I bought.\n\nEverything else is software minimalism now. I removed my previous ROM and installed LineageOS on my phone. And, I\nremoved Windows and installed Linux. (Technically, I have been using Linux for years by now, but I did remove windows.)\nHow are your devices set up?\nLet's start with my phone because it was the thing I used the most while being aware that I am using it the most, and it was\nwasting my time more than I was utilizing it.\nLineageOS (Android)\nThe first thing I will see when I pick up my phone is the lock screen, and it is set up such that my screen will not light\nup when I receive a notification, but, the notifications are visible with content in the lock screen because it is easier for\nme to decide if I need to respond immediately, or it can wait.\nI have my phone almost perpetually in DND mode with the exception of my parents being in favorite and being able to ring me anytime.\nFor others, if I receive two calls within a 15-second interval, I'll get the call. And all text messages and notifications are\ndisabled while the DND Mode is on.\nNow, let the phone be unlocked. I have YAM Launcher installed, and I will only be able to see the time on the\nhome screen. Upon a swipe up, the app list opens up with only text and edited to represent what it'll do instead of\nthe app's name.\n\n\nApp List\n\nBrowser - Firefox Nightly\nCalculator\nCamera\nContacts\nDevices - KDE Connect\nEmail - Thunderbird Daily\nFiles\nGallery - Aves Gallery\nMessaging\nPackages - Obtainium\nPasswords - Bitwarden (Keyguard)\nPhone\nReader - Readest\nRecorder\nSettings\nSignal - Signal FOSS\nTerminal - Termux\nVideos - VLC\nYouTube - NewPipe (Tubular)\n\n\nInside the browser I have UBlock Origin installed, and it blocks all ads and redirects and also YouTube. YouTube links\non my phone are automatically redirected to NewPipe which has no feeds and suggestions, only search and play.\nKDE Connect is for transferring files from my phone to my laptop and vice versa and sometimes clipboard contents, but If\nI really need it; I could ssh into either of the devices and get what I want, (in my local network). I used to use tailscale\nas a VPN, but I have not felt the need of it for now.\nObtainium is to install packages and updates to my apps, since LineageOS doesn't have an app store. It gets apps straight from sources like\ngit-services, fdroids-repos and web-links. I can get the apps from right where the bakers baked it.\nEvery other app is pretty self-explanatory and they do their job well.\nNixOS (Linux)\nI have a full-fledged desktop environment (DE) and a minimal window manager (WM) installed on my laptop. I normally live on my window manager\nbut sometimes it doesn't cut it, or I have to configure it (which takes some time) so I just fall back on the DE and get the work done. Yes it\nbreaks from the \"DRY\" principle, but WM and DE are like my DND Focus and Normal Mode for the laptop.\nNix Package Manager also works somewhat like obtainium (I am oversimplifying this a lot.) I can get the apps straight from source and compile it\non device or I can get the packages from the NixOS repos.\nTechnically, the terminal and the browser should be sufficient for everything. But I like my dedicated apps.\nWindow Manager (Niri)\nMy window manager is set up in such a way that everything is hidden by default. If I hover over the correct places on my screen, I will get what I\nwant to quickly access like brightness, volume, mic sensitivity, time, battery and the tray.\n\nAnd the scrolling tiling window management is by far the best window management workflow I have experienced till now. I can categorize\nmy windows in 2 dimensions (Technically all 3, but I rarely want to use the third.) and choose to focus on 1–2 windows while all other windows\nare one swipe away. I can't explain it by just yapping about it here, you need to use it to feel it.\nDesktop Environment (GNOME)\nIt looks similar to niri at first glance, but I have tweaked it with extensions to be minimal. I don't open it unless I am playing a game from Steam or using an app that only supports XOrg because niri doesn't have XWayland support and the workarounds are a bit clunky. Or, if niri crashes for some reason.\nBrowser(s)\n\nFirefox (Gecko) - I have my own userCSS and that is the workflow I want in my browser, minimal by default, powerful when needed.\nQuteBrowser (Blink/QTWebEngine) - It is almost what I wanted in a chromium based browser, if only it had support for Firefox extensions.\nEpiphany (WebKit) - It's a WebKit browser when I need to test things for a WebKit environment.\n\nFirefox is the only browser that has extensions support on my device. I have UBlockOrigin, Unhook, SponsorBlock, VimiumC and Bitwarden installed\nand if not all, UBlockOrigin and Bitwarden are the absolute must-haves for me. [I am spoiled by UBlockOrigin.]\nQuteBrowser is my current primary browser because I feel like it uses less power than Firefox does. Also, it is minimal and uses the\nwhole area for web rendering and not browser components like url-bar and buttons and menus, and also it is entirely keyboard\noriented with VIM-style workflow. I have set its AdBlock to use UBlockOrigin's block list, and it does pretty well, but not as well as UBlockOrigin.\nUnlike Firefox, I have left the YouTube feed to show up in it, but I don't play YouTube on the browser but instead utilize MPV and yt-dlp to watch\non my video player of choice. (The YouTube player is automatically paused and hidden using a greasemonkey script, which is the closest to extensions that Qute has.)\nEpiphany is a browser I almost never use but keep for the sake of testing stuff on WebKit when doing web development.\nApplications\nI said \"app\" for mobile but \"application\" for desktop because they are exactly how they sound like.\n\nApp List\n\nBrowsers - We already discussed them.\nTerminal - Ghostty + Alacritty (I couldn't choose between features and minimalism on this one.)\nInkscape - Vector Graphics\nEmacs - Note-taking using org-roam and for almost nothing else.\nNeovide - Neovim dedicated GUI where I do all my text editing and programming.\nNewsFlash - RSS Reader\nThunderbird - Email Client\nSteam - For Hollow Knight which I play once a month\nValent - A gnome implementation of KDE Connect\nFractal - A matrix client\nFoliate - Book Reader\nSioyek - PDF Reader\nFragments - Torrent Client\nRefine - The New Gnome Tweaks\nGnome Apps - Weather, Software, Files, Audio Player, Discs, Camera, Calculator, etc.\nSpotify + Spicetify - Music Streaming\nTelegram - Chat\nSignal - Chat\n\n\nThe things I mostly use are QuteBrowser and Ghostty and I can prolly do the entirety of what I do within these two apps.\n(Maybe I'll use Firefox instead of Qute if I was forced to use only two apps.)\nSocial Media\nYes! It deserves its own topic. It's not like I don't use social media, how did you find this blog?\nBut I don't use social media as much. I am not a saint, and I do use things like Microsoft, Meta, and Google\nServices and Social media they offer because that's where everyone is.\nMy favourite is The Fediverse; it's calm, and I can get caught up with everyone I follow within 5 minutes of scrolling,\nnot even that much. But as much as I love you guys, I still have real-life friends who don't use and don't know about the Fediverse.\nSo, I have to use Facebook Messenger to contact almost anyone I know. But I have my Facebook ID\ndeactivated to only use Messenger and don't have Instagram and also WhatsApp.\nI made a LinkedIn account a while back, and I sometimes scroll through it to check what everyone\nis up to. I do post once in a while but have not done anything worthy of posting there lately.\nI have Telegram just to check in with custom ROM communities and mobile Linux communities, but I rarely do that nowadays.\nSignal for the dearest who do use it. It's what I use for texting people and have it on my phone as well.\nLastly, let's talk about YouTube. I didn't consider it a social media and used to use the full-fledged YouTube apps, but\nI got so addicted to it that I could not stop scrolling, looking for videos to watch. I spent most of the time of the\nday on it. But it is definitely a social media, and it definitely should be used and not consumed. And I hate shorts with\npassion. Most of my device usage was for YouTube and YouTube only. I am still a YouTube addict, but I am consuming less and\nusing it more each day.\nLastly\nThough, reading all this (if you really did) made you feel like it is definitely not a minimalist setup. It really is.\nI feel like I have fixed my social media overconsumption with this setup. At least I am getting more work done and also\ngetting a good sleep.\nI used to take my phone to bed and scroll YouTube till I slept, and I would always sleep the next day (i.e., after 00:00)\nbut now I get sleep at 10 and will be asleep within 10 minutes. (That is, unless something is bugging me.)\nMy phone does absolutely nothing to distract me, and I don't have my laptop at all times. The only thing I don't have that is\nnecessary is banking apps, but not having that has made me spend even less, so it's still a win.\n\nI have been writing this since 04:45 and it's 08:45, I'll be back after breakfast.\n09:06 I'm Back!\n\nYeah! I don't think I have more to write about it. The flow got interrupted. I had to do something for my addiction, and it\nis what I did. Hopefully I don't fall back into the same trap again.

Searching for a command from a huge list of buttons is a hassle, if you know what the command is you can immediately execute the particular command in a split second.

Commands can be piped together (ls | grep filename), they can be captured (gcc program.c &gt; ./standard_out 2&gt; ./standard_error), and can be substituted (ls /home/whoami or ls /home/$(whoami))\nDetailed information about what a program is doing can be seen in TUI interface which is generally disabled in GUI for the sake of making the it look beautiful.\nBecause of the ability to automate tasks. cron and bash scripts allow long, complicated, and/or repetitive tasks to either be simplified or automated completely.\nIt is universal and is same across all kinds of *nix operating system despite of the use of different DEs , Themes or Layouts.\nYou get to know and handle the tools better.\n\nDisadvantages of using a CLI\n\nRemembering all the differrent commands is hectic.\nMultimedia applications are useless.\nA lot of inappropriate command some would say.\nBad for certain tasks that involves graphical UI.\nThings that require a lot of typing, such as long file names, can be annoying without minimal cut/paste support.\n\nPeople when they feel the need of using a CLI get scared of the *nix operating systems (Windows do have a command line interface but not as powerful as the *nix terminal.), this is a reason why people are afraid to try linux and is it's greatest dis-advantage.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/terminal-and-cli/","title":"Terminal and CLI"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/the-beauty-of-night/":{"body":"After the daytime colorful and bright,\nThe sun goes down and then comes night.\nNo light , no colors, lack of sight,\nThe only colors left are black and white.\nEverything is dark and colors are gone,\nThe sky turns black in the absence of sun.\nThe moon and the stars rise in the sky,\nWhat also rise are millions of \"why ?\".\nEvery night I see those stars,\nAnd wonder how many there are.\nYes, they are huge but they are far,\nAll I see is the past of the stars.\nSome red , some blue and others are white,\nReds are far &amp; blues are near says the light.\nThere's one Moon but stars infinite,\nAll of these shows the beauty of night.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/the-beauty-of-night/","title":"The Beauty Of Night"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/the-end/":{"body":"I am and will be yours and you are mine until the end.

Tildes are pubnixes - (Public Access Unix Systems) inspired by tilde.club which was created by Paul Ford in 2014. These are very useful to those who want to learn about *nix\n(GNU/Linux, Unix, BSD, etc) systems.\nIt's name is a combination of 'Tilde ()' and 'Universe'. Here, Tilde means 'Home' because () is a sign that represents the home directory in *nix systems.\nPubnixes - (Public Access Unix Systems) in simple terms are computers across the world that can be accessed via the internet. These computer run *nix operating systems and are accessed using Secure Shell (SSH).\nPeople Can Use It To :\nBuild Webpages\nPeople can create their own websites for free. Most tildes provide a folder where you can create and store a .html file which automatically becomes a website ( Domain is determined by respective tilde communities where you signed up. ) and can be instantly viewed it by  going to the assigned web address.\nBuild Gemini Capsules\nLike normal websites Gemini capsules also are \"websites\" on a different protocol called Gemini. People can host their Gemini Capsules like they can host websites.  Tildes provide a folder where you can create and store a .gmi file which automatically becomes a capsule and can be instantly viewed by going to the assigned gemini address.\nBuild Gopher Holes\nLike gemini capsules gopher holes also are \"websites\" on a different protocol called Gopher. People can host their Gopher Holes like they can host websites.  Tildes provide a folder where you can create and store a text file which automatically becomes a gopher hole and can be instantly viewed by going to the assigned gopher address.\nLearn to use nix*\nMore than 70 percentage of people in the world are using Windows as their OS and many don't even know what an OS is, these computers on the other hand runs nix*. Nix* includes operating systems like GNU/Linux, BSD, Unix etc. These are generally used in servers; most of the servers runs GNU/Linux. People can learn to navigate between files and folders and use terminal based applications provided by the tildes helping to grasp how *nix is designed and organized.\nWrite Software\nTildes provide people with a suite of programs by which they can write software and learn. People can write code in Vim as well as Nano if  preferred. They can ask the administrator to install specific programs of their tilde doesn't have one.\nPlay TUI games\nTUI stands for Text User Interface; like GUI - Graphical User Interface. Since It doesn't have a GUI, people are limited to the games that are made for TUI and also to the games that are provided respective tilde.  One of the common games on tildes is 'botany' where people grow a plant, water it, crossbreed it, exchange seeds with friends etc.\nConduct Shows\nYou can even conduct web radio shows ( AzuraCast Streams ) on tildes, particularly on tilderadio.org if you are interested in it.\nUse Tilde Services and Projects\nServices like  tilde-chat, tilde-git, tilde-radio, mastodon, writefreely, minecraft, tilde-news,tildeverse jitsi, tildeverse mumble etc are available to use for tilde users to communicate and interact with each other.  For more info about services go to :\nTildeverse\n\nBasically, It is a unified hub of decentralized services and pubnixes where people can use their nerdy programs, do their nerdy works, interact with similar nerdy peoples having fun and learning.\n\nDifference Between Tildes\n\n\nServices like Emails, NNTP, PHP etc are offered by limited tildes. For example, ~town does not offer email at all (only internal mail), cosmic could only send/receive emails in Tildeverse. NNTP service is only natively offered by ~club, team, cosmic, and your.\n\n\nSoftwares like weechat, botany, etc are available in limited tildes. This is also determined by the operating system used in them.\n\n\nDifferent tildes use different Operating Systems that determine the shell, applications, usability etc.\n\n\nTildes are located all over the world, so there is also a difference of geographical location where a certain tilde is located.\n\n\nTildes have their own specific themes, cosmic.voyage have a science fiction based theme, breadcrumb have a baker kind of theme, etc.\n\n\nParticular tildes have particular objectives and specific tasks like ~radio, ~chat, etc.\n\n\n~team provides XMPP service that bridges to ~chat  and envs.net do Matrix bridging.\n\n\nWhy nix* though ?\nThis section from Paul Ford's essay about tildeverse explains :\nFull Essay\nYour typical \"cloud\" Unix server, designed in the 1970s to be a very social place, is today a ghost town with one or two factories still clanking in the town square - factories that receive our email, or accept our Instagram photos and store them, and manage our data. But there's no one walking around and chatting downtown.\nThus when people talk about \"cloud computing\" they are talking about millions of tiny ghost towns. Ironic, because what do people build on these ghost towns but social networks.\nIn the last decade, social networks like Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook - even Google Plus appeared. They tried to bring all those lonesome folks back together, into one enormous room. Not just a few dozen people on one computer but millions, even a billion people all sharing one giant meta-computer. Many of those services make very heavy use of Unix under the hood. So: We collectively took a very social computing platform, papered over its social parts, and used it to build a social computing platform.\nPurely for kicks, I decided to turn the social part back on and throw\na nerd party.\nLinks\nGemini Capsule of Tildeverse\nMore About Tildeverse\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/tildeverse/","title":"Tildeverse"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/time-travelling-with-you/":{"body":"We have this plan, and it's on my mind for a very long time.

They operate over the BitTorrent protocol. The BitTorrent protocol helps in sharing data in a decentralized manner.\n\n\nTorrenting is the process of downloading and hosting torrents using the BitTorrent protocol.\n\n\nWorkings of Torrenting\nThis is done by breaking down large files into many bits and later connecting those bits together. Torrenting works by using decentralized servers to download files, and each participant in this file-sharing activity is engaged in downloading and uploading files. That is to say, all Torrent users rely on each other to carry on the file transfer activity. Essentially, you are sharing the file being downloaded while it is still in the process of downloading, without having to wait for the whole file to download.\n\nA single person uploads a file (Makes a torrent).\n\n\nA torrent can be distributed using a hash; often called a magnet link or a TORRENT file.\n\n\nThe file is downloaded by another person.\nThe device of another person now acts as a server and involves in the supplying of that file too.\nAs the number of people downloading the file increases, the number of servers increases, making it better available when one or more server is inactive or disconnected.\nSince the file was broken into pieces, some pieces of the file goes from one server and some from another, sharing the bandwidth with the main server.\n\nTerms in Torrenting\nSeed\nIf the user downloads a torrent and the torrent client starts uploading the file for other people to download, the file the downloader is uploading which is available for other users to download from is a seed.\nPeer\nA peer is someone downloading the file from a seeder and does not have the full file yet.\nLeech\nIf a user downloads a torrent but refuses to distribute it then the file is called a leech (Maybe the user is called a leech.).\nSwarm\nA swarm is a group of people who are sharing and downloading the same toerrent.\nTracker\nIt is a server that tracks the users of the torrent and helps to locate each other for data transmission.\nClient\nA client is a program that recognizes the torrent file or the magnet hash and does the downloading and uploading task.\nIndexers\nIndexers are the websites that collects and stores a huge number of torrents.

A bit too must at this point. Whenever I get the chance I just sit down and open typst. Electricity goes down, I open typst. I feel bored I open typst.\nNow that I think of it, I don't have anything else to do on my laptop and only interactive thing is typst.\nYou might be thinking what typst is. So, let me introduce you to typst.\nIntroduction to typst\nTypst is a typesetting software that help you make documents. And since documents are the things we all just need to make, it is one of the most essential piece of software for everyone.\nIt is no new idea [I mean, it is a new idea but, making documents using a typesetting in plaintext has been a thing since ages.] There has been LaTeX and Markdown and org and other typesetting software and each of them have their own strengths and weaknesses. Typst aims to achieve all their strengths and none of their weaknesses. At least, that is how I see typst to be.\nComparing Typst with other typesetting software\nPropertiesTypstLaTexMarkdownOrg\nFast PreviewYesNoYesYes\nLightweightYesNoYesNo\nExtensibleYesYesNoYes\nSimple SyntaxYesNoYesYes\nPlatform AgnosticYesYesYesNo\nAutomatic Dependency ManagementYesNoNot SupportedNot Supported\nSingle BinaryYesNoNoNo\n\nLet me tell you what all these means too:\n\n\nFast Preview: If you can see the changes live as you type.\n\n\nLightweight: If it can be installed quickly and has a small footprint(storage consumption).\n\n\nExtensible: If modules/packages can be made and used as dependencies that you can just import. Like templates, styles and formatting that can just be imported to use.\n\n\nSimple Syntax: If you can do the basic formatting without needing to know complex syntax for it. For e.g.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatform Agnostic: Here technically every software is platform agnostic and can be used in any text editor of your choice but the complete \"Org-mode\" is only available in emacs and is very difficult to replicate it anywhere else.\n\n\nAutomatic Dependency Management: I only realised that it is a thing when I actually used Typst, but if you import something, the LSP automatically installs the module if it isn't available on your device. Latex cannot do that and the other software are not extensible so, you cannot use modules at all.\n\n\nSingle Binary: This makes typst very portable and easy to install since it doesn't need to rely on other packages in the system to work. Which is not the case with Latex at all and not for others too unless they are, in that case, sorry I didn't know.\n\n\nHow I use it\nI use typst with my text editor of choice neovim. If you ask a person who uses Neovim as their text editor, they'll say how much they hate it when they have to type text in a normal text editor. Since it is just plain text, I surely can write it without the need of any LSP or Plugins and use the typst compiler to render it continuously on save. But, it has a LSP called tinymist and it has a previewer plugin for Neovim called typst-preview which generates live SVG preview and any good browser can render it.\nThe best thing about tinymist and typst-preview coming from vimtex for LaTeX, the preview is instant and it also follows the cursor as I move in neovim. When, I am bored I just scroll on my neovim to see the preview scroll automatically on the browser.\nTalking about browser, I use qutebrowser for preview since it supports the VIM keys by default and I can remove all the UI elements to just see the preview while it being a full fledged browser. And it is just awesome.\nI use lazy as my plugin manager for neovim and the following snippet sets my whole environment for typst apart from installing typst itself and qutebrowser:\n\nHere is how my typst setup looks like. It doesn't look like much but it works too well. I use harper-ls for my grammar checking and with everything on the single environment I can write my documents in the editor I want with proper formatting, live preview and offline grammar checking. What more can I ask for?\n\nIf you want to check the document and see how I have formatted it you can see the source code here, and the compliled PDF here. You can also visit the directory in github.\nYou might be wondering, why I didn't mention Microsoft or Google Docs.\nI forgot about it. I am being honest here, I forgot about it while writing the comparison but the typst homepage has a pretty nice comparison between LaTeX, Typst and Google Docs.\nBut, if you want to know my take on these Word Processing Software is that I just hate aligning and placing figures and images in them. The age old meme still holds true. (Or, maybe it's my skill issue.)\n\nMandatory \"In the end\"\nI love using typst. I feel like I have made documents in typst more than I have used any other software to make documents in my life. And after the neovim setup I just fell madly, deeply, truly in love with it. And I just recommend it to everyone and want typst to grow to the point where all academic journals accept it as a format to support papers in. It will be just smooth sailing from there on.\nMy only wish is being able to do Literate Programming in typst, then it'll be the best for writing reproducable technical documents, kinda like what org can do with org-tangle. But, it is just a wish and if someone esle doesn't, I might try to make it a reality.\nThis much for today, I might add more to this if I feel like I missed something. Or, maybe I will write a follow up blog on this.

But, the drawback of any kind of unique and DIY technology is not having people that actually use it.\nIronically, after the setup, I only have received Webmentions from myself during testing (I am not counting the mastodon likes that propagated through Bridgy Fed). I am still sceptical about Bridgy Fed because It isn't what I wanted Webmentions to be, I didn't want any connections to a social media but I wanted to test the workings so I connected it.\nHow I Do It\nMy blog is a static site and being static comes with the cost of not being able to continuously listen to incoming messages. So, Webmentions don't really work on a static site. At least that's what I thought at first, then I found out about webmention.io.\nIt's sort of like a retrofitted static site to support Webmentions.\nComponents\n\nA Static Site Generator www.getzola.org\nIndieweb Compatibility indiewebify.me\nSend webmentions webmention.app\nReceive Webmentions webmention.io\nRender Webmentions keats.github.io/tera\nRunner GitHub actions\n\nA Static Site Generator\nI am using zola as my static site generator and I love it. The comfort of just writing in markdown and letting zola do the heavy lifting to generate feeds is awesome. Generating an Atom/RSS feed is a must. This is needed by webmention.app to send webmentions by reading all your posts.\nIndieweb Compatibility\nTo make an Indieweb compatible static site you need to pass these tests from indiewebify.me.\n\nWeb Sign In - This helps you sign in to indieweb services with your domain. You must have your own registered domain name.\nh-card and h-entry classes on homepage as well as on the \"post\" page.\nAbility to send Webmentions.\n\nSending Webmentions\nI use my generated Atom feed and webmention.app CLI to send Webmentions.\nIt is as simple as running:\n\nReceiving Webmentions\nTo receive Webmentions you need a perpetual listening server and the service is provided by webmention.io.\n\nSign into webmention.io with your domain. It will use indielogin.com. This requires you to have at least an email address on your h-card.\nGo to sites and in the table click on Get Setup Code which will give you a tag to put on your HTML template header.\nTest that you actually can receive Webmentions by mentioning yourself in a site and running the above command. It should show up in the dashboard of webmention.io.\n\nRender Webmentions\nYou can now fetch the json feed of the Webmentions you have received in webmention.io using the following command and replacing the ${WEBMENTION_TOKEN} with your own token.\n\nThis json file can be used to render the Webmentions on your website using your static site generator's feature to read json files.\nI made and activity page in zola where all the webmention activities are listed.\n\nZola Template HTML\nThis is located at templates/activity.html and used at content/activity/_index.md\ntemplates/activity.html\n\ncontent/activity/_index.md\n\n\nWebmentions are rendered by zola utilizing the load_data function of tera templating engine. The fetched webmention.json file is parsed and formatted. [Can be seen in activity.html in the above template.]\nRunner\nTo rebuild the site by fetching new Webmentions we will need a runner that does the process repeatedly in said amount of time. This is where GitHub actions come in. I have three workflows send-webmentions.yaml, zola.yml and fetch-webmentions.yaml which as the name says, sends Webmentions from the site, builds the site using zola and fetches received Webmentions from webmention.io.\nFor fetching I have saved my webmention.app api key as a secret in GitHub and use that in the workflow file.\nFirst put your token form webmention.io in settings &gt; security &gt; secrets and variables &gt; actions &gt; new repository secret of your GitHub repo with the name WEBMENTION_TOKEN.\nThen, the workflow files should be put in place.\n\nWorkflow Files\nThis is located at .github/workflows/ from the root of your repository.\nFirst workflow fetches new mentions every 30 minutes.\nfetch-webmentions.yml\n\nSecond workflow builds the site from the source after fetching the Webmentions.\nzola.yml\n\nThird workflow sends Webmentions from the detected links in the newly generated atom.xml.\nsend-webmentions.yml\n\n\nSending Webmentions\nIn order to send Webmentions, the content should be formatted accordingly. In general I like to utilize three activities to send Webmentions.\n[It is preferred to only use one activity for one mention.]\nMention\nOne can mention a site using webmention by simply putting the link to the page being mentioned.\nThe site will get the webmention if it supports it.\n\nLike\nOne can like a post using webmention by formatting the link as follows:\n\nI like how flux talks about his bed in Void Bed\nReply\nOne can reply to a post by formatting the link and the text as follows:\n\nBridges\nThough I have connected this site to the fediverse with Bridgy Fed, it is opt in using a zola shortcode. Because, I want the articles to have a \"blog interaction\" from other peoples blog but not from the social media. But, I do use bridgy on my short posts sometimes. Webmentions and Linux is/not Difficult are some posts I have used bridgy with and they also work as example posts to see how different webmention activities look like in my website.\nLastly\nI had forgotten about webmentions and interactions on my site, but I recently read a post from Joel titled Webmentions but manual (for Jekyll) and people giving names to the interactions really caught my attention. I haven't given it a name because mine are just Webmentions but I feel like Webmentions are still a good option to have (with much less spam) for interaction if it isn't connected to an actual social media.\nSome other posts I read were:\n[At least for the sake of just pinging them.]\nImplementing Community Echoes\nBlog interactions\nWhat Others Said...\nI hope webmention on blogging sites takes off. Or maybe it has already taken off. I want the future where everyone can express themselves with their own taste and creativity not having to compromise personality for protocols.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/webmentions/","title":"Static Site Webmentions"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/who-he-was/":{"body":"He had lived a life of a villagen; who was neither a villager nor a citizen. He was seen as a citizen by his village friends and a villager by his city friends. To his view he was a citizen as he lived in a town for studying and went to his village if there was a holiday of any sort.\nAnd because of that he knew the customs of the both worlds. The tradition and behaviours of village as well as the city had moulded him and his behaviours, as he wanted to be treated as native by both of his friend groups.\nVillage:\nAs a kid he would take goats for grazing, climb trees, run down the hill to the river, played with mud and sticks, football made up of clothes stuffed inside a sock, fly kites, slide in coconut leaves, made wheels by cutting slippers soles and run assuming they were cars or bikes.\nIn his teens he would still go to the village where his grandparents lived farming, ploughing and growing stuff. But he would not get a chance to experience how all those things were done. He'd sit as an outsider and watch them plough the field, controlling and turning bulls at their command and made them drag the plough on the filed.\nThey worried about him and his nice, clean clothes and would ask him to stay far from the field and not get dirty. He wore his dad's old clothes and went to the field sometimes, but they still wouldn't give him a chance to work, saying he'd get hurt.\nCity:\nWhile he was in the city, he'd play snake on his dad's Nokia and watch cartoons like Ben 10, Pokémon, Bakugan, Dragon Ball Z, Tom and Jerry, Moo min, Zig and Sharko, etc on TV.\nHis dad got a smarter but still keypad phone (Nokia X1) which had internet, and he made his first Facebook account in it. He would download Java games like Assassin's Creed, Spider-Man, Ben 10, Mario, Diamond Rush etc from Waptrick. When bored he would dig through the deepest settings of the phone and change things, which might have planted his love for computers at that time, and he still does it.\nHe'd often go to his friend's house and watch them play with their PSPs and Computers. He was always fascinated by how those things worked.\nHere his friends would not let him play with their PSPs and Computers as he didn't know how to use them, and they were afraid if he would break it. As smartphones were at the market, his uncle gifted his mom with a Samsung Smartphone, and he played offline games like Temple Run, Mario, Plant vs Zombies, etc in it. The mobile data costs were high at that time and that has an effect on him till today; he doesn't play online games.\nInfluence\nHe knew things of both village and town and even the teachers who taught them about primitive technologies and  other old things would be shocked by seeing him recognize everything they read from the book since he had seen them being used. He taught his friends to communicate secretly by the special language he learnt at the village (basically it was putting a special syllable before every syllable and speaking it that way. The special syllable was \"cha\" and the word 'development' would be \"cha-dev cha-lop cha-ment\" but in our native language of course.)\nHe'd teach his village friends to make a Facebook account, upload posts, download games on their phones and all that \"techy stuff\" they thought was magic. He shared downloaded movies and music to them. He was a tech guy to everyone there. He still gets calls from his relatives if any kind of mobile related problems occur to them.\nIt is surely due to limited resources, He would use everything by pushing it to the limits. Still today, he digs through the settings of a newer looking phone, hoping he'd find new interesting stuff.\n\nHe was never a native and that made him unique which he still enjoys being.\n\nToday\nToday he went to his village for a visit, and was devastated by the collapsing old house as it is abandoned and nobody cares for it. He got one day to recall all memories he spent as a child and also a teen. One day of sitting on the floor eating with hands in a smokey warm kitchen with food grown in the kitchen garden or rather \"kitchen field\" with no added chemicals. One day of eating fruits by picking it himself from the tree. One day of gazing at the stars shining brightly above the heaven below. One day of wishing to meet his old friends who mostly are now abroad for money. All those memories to come back melting the heart and eyes of who he was, me.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/who-he-was/","title":"Who He Was"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/wonderland/":{"body":"I wonder what a blind man sees.\nDoes he see darkness like I do\nor does he feel colors through his ears?\nI wonder what a deaf woman hears.\nDoes she feel silence like I do\nor does she enjoy music with her eyes?\nI wonder what a dead person thinks.\nDoes it think of nothingness which I can't\nor does it think with it's soul flying?

Traditional methods of waste collection and dumping are labor-intensive and often inefficient. By integrating robotics and advanced algorithms, we can streamline these processes, reduce human effort, and ensure a cleaner environment. This project, 'manoid', aims to demonstrate how a robot can autonomously detect, navigate, and manage waste using only a single overhead camera and advanced computer vision techniques.\n\nI have written another blog post related to this: Manoid: Communication\n\nLet's see how it was made.\nRequirements:\nCategoryComponent\nHardwareESP32 Microcontroller\nHardwareL298N Motor Driver\nHardwareDC Motor and Wheels\nHardwareA 12V Battery\nHardwareA camera (I used my phone with an IP Camera app for video streaming)\nSoftwarePython (for publishing)\nSoftwareArduino IDE (for ESP32 firmware)\nSoftwaremosquitto (for serving)\n\nBasic Setup\nSetting Up Arduino IDE\nTo install the ESP32 board in your Arduino IDE, follow these instructions:\n\nIn your Arduino IDE, go to File &gt; Preferences.\nEnter the following into the “Additional Board Manager URLs” field:\n\n\n\nClick the “OK” button.\nOpen the Boards Manager. Go to Tools &gt; Board &gt; Boards Manager.\nSearch for ESP32 and press the install button for the “ESP32 by Espressif Systems”.\nOnce installed, select your ESP32 board in Tools &gt; Board menu.\nSelect the appropriate Port in Tools &gt; Port menu (in my case it was the DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1).\n\nNow your Arduino IDE is set up to work with ESP32.\nSetting Up The Environment\nI've got my environment all sorted out with Nix and Nix Flake, and I've made it even easier with direnv activation. Mosquitto's up and running smoothly on its default port 1883. python and it's dependencies opencv,numpy,paho-mqtt and flask in a virtual environment are set up via nix flakes as well. You can look at the nix documentation to know more about how it works.\nTo set it up:\n\nI assume that nix is installed with flakes enabled on your computer.\nClone the repo and enter the environment by running nix develop or allowing direnv to do it for you if you have it installed.\n\n\n\nA MQTT server will be running as soon as you enter the environment on the default port of 1883 and you can check the logs using the screen command.\nChange parameters to match your device and make sure everything in on point.\nRun the main.py script and admire the magic.\n\nChanging Parameters\nWhen adjusting parameters due to dynamic changes in Wi-Fi or IP addresses, several key locations in the code need to be updated to ensure MQTT and IP camera is properly connected. Here's a breakdown of where to make these adjustments:\nIn the esp32.ino file:\n\nIn the main.py file:\n\nTuning the motors is essential because it directly impacts the robot's movement, responsiveness, and overall efficiency. Factors such as the size, power, and weight distribution of the robot, as well as the surface it operates on, can all influence how the motors should be configured.\nIn the esp32.py file:\n\nIn the main.py file (tuning PID settings):\n\nMaking the bot:\n\nAssemble the bot following the diagram below:\n\n\n\nThen open the file inside the project directory on etc/esp32/esp32.ino on your Arduino IDE set up to work with esp32 and change the parameters to fit your environment.\nAnd finally flash it!\n\n\n\nYou can test the bot manually by connecting to the mqtt server using an application (like MyMQTT on android) and sending values from 0 to 255 to the topics :\n/robot6_left_forward\n/robot6_left_backward\n/robot6_right_forward\n/robot6_right_backard\nwhere 0 being the wheels at no speed and 255 being the max speed\n\nWhat is in the code?\nThe Functions, duh!\n\nClick to expand: The Functions\nThis list contains the functions involved in the robot, with each function's purpose:\n1. get_warped_frame(input_frame, marker_ids, PAD)\n\nDetects ArUco markers in the input frame.\nExtracts the corners of specified markers.\nWarps the frame to correct perspective if all specified markers are detected.\nReturns the warped frame and marker corners.\n\n2. calculate_scale(corners, marker_physical_size_cm)\n\nCalculates the scale of the marker in pixels per centimeter.\nUses the distance between two corners of the marker.\n\n3. adjust_marker_corners(corners, offset_x_cm, offset_y_cm, adjust_width_cm, adjust_height_cm, marker_physical_size_cm)\n\nAdjusts the marker corners based on given offsets and size adjustments in centimeters.\n\n4. detect_aruco_markers(frame, aruco_dict_type)\n\nDetects ArUco markers in the frame.\nProcesses the detected markers and adjusts corners if necessary.\nReturns the detected markers with their centers and corners.\n\n5. heuristic(a, b)\n\nCalculates the Manhattan distance between two points.\nUsed in pathfinding algorithms.\n\n6. astar(start, goal, obstacles, grid_size)\n\nImplements the A* algorithm to find the shortest path from start to goal.\nConsiders obstacles and returns the path if found.\n\n7. connect_mqtt()\n\nConnects to the MQTT broker to enable robot communication.\n\n8. send_mqtt_command(topic, command)\n\nSends a command to the robot via MQTT.\n\n9. get_bot_position(bot_id, markers)\n\nRetrieves the current position of a robot based on its marker ID.\n\n10. calculate_distances(robot_corners, next_position)\n\nCalculates the distances from the robot's center and corners to the next position.\n\n11. move_towards_goal(robot_id, path, threshold)\n\nMoves the robot towards the goal following the given path using PID control.\n\n12. draw_lines_to_goal(frame, robot_corners, goal_position, color, thickness)\n\nDraws lines from the robot's corners and center to the goal position on the frame.\n\n13. draw_path(frame, path, color, thickness, grid_size)\n\nDraws the planned path on the frame.\n\n14. get_head_position(robot_id, markers)\n\nReturns the head position and corners of the robot based on its marker ID.\n\n15. get_waste_positions(markers, waste_id)\n\nFilters and returns the positions of a specific type of waste.\n\n16. fill_grid_cells_from_corners(corners, grid_size)\n\nReturns all grid cells covered by a rectangle defined by its corners.\n\n17. update_obstacles(markers, target_waste_ids, robot_head_pos)\n\nUpdates the list of obstacles and finds the nearest waste position.\n\n18. convert_to_grid_coordinates(position, cell_size)\n\nConverts a position to grid coordinates based on the cell size.\n\n19. convert_obstacles_to_grid(obstacles, cell_size)\n\nConverts a set of positions to grid coordinates.\n\n20. convert_grid_to_actual(path, cell_size)\n\nConverts a path of grid coordinates back to actual coordinates.\n\n21. plan_path(start, goal, obstacles)\n\nPlans a path using the A* algorithm and returns it in actual coordinates.\n\n22. find_nearest_edge_midpoint_to_robot(robot_pos, marker_id, markers)\n\nFinds the nearest edge midpoint of a marker relative to the robot's position.\n\n23. pickup_waste(robot_id)\n\nSends a command to the robot to pick up the waste.\n\n24. drop_off_waste(robot_id, waste_id)\n\nSends a command to the robot to drop off the waste and marks it as processed.\n\n25. robot_control_loop(robot_id)\n\nMain control loop for the robot:\n\nConnects to MQTT.\nDetects waste, navigates to it, picks it up, and drops it off.\nRepeats the process continuously.\n\n\n\n26. capture_and_update_shared_resources(url)\n\nContinuously captures video frames.\nDetects markers and updates shared resources with the frame and markers.\n\n27. visualize_robot_behavior()\n\nVisualizes the robot's current behavior on the frame.\nDraws the robot's position, planned path, obstacles, and goal on the frame.\n\n\n\nFinally\nTesting\nTo test only the main.py file for it's pathfinding capabilities, you can run the ./pngstream.py file in the etc directory and put http://127.0.0.1:5000/video_feed on the following placeholder in main.py:\n\nand then run main.py. This will open up a window with the png showing the detected path in the screen along with detecting all the ArUco markers. If only the markers are detected and the path doesn't show up, it can be assumed that the code isn't working corrctly.\n\nI suggest testing this way as soon as nix finishes setting the environment and keep testing the code like this to minimize the need to test it physically.\n\nTroubleshooting Common Issues\n\nConnection Problems: If the robot fails to connect to the MQTT broker, double-check your Wi-Fi credentials and ensure the broker's IP address is correct in both the ESP32 firmware and main.py. (The main.py script will print errors if something isn't properly connected.)\nMovement Issues: If the robot's movements are erratic or it doesn't move as expected, recheck the motor connections and ensure the PWM values are correctly tuned in main.py and esp32.ino.\nMarker Detection Failures: If the robot cannot detect ArUco markers, ensure the camera feed is clear and unobstructed. Adjust the camera's focus and lighting conditions to improve detection accuracy.\"\n\nPossible Improvements\n\nIn my pathfinding algorithm, I don't search for the diagonal paths which lengthens the \"short path\" as I wanted the robot to face the waste or the destination from either sides of the square and not the corners.\nMaking swarm robots instead of using only one.\nMaking the code object-oriented.\nAdding grippers to grab the waste instead of the 5-second delay and drop the waste on its destination.\n\n\nWe had added the functionalities of gripping and swarm navigation when using this bot on a Robotics Competition in Nepal called Yantra Swarmanoid but decided to remove it on this showcase, though the code to grab and drop the waste is still in there in 'main.py'.\n\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/blog/yantra-bot/","title":"Manoid: A Waste Management Robot"},"https://scientiac.space/blog/you-were-true/":{"body":"It won't always be the same.\nYou always said to me.\nIt won't always be the same.\nI never wanted to agree.\nIt won't always be the same.\nYet all endings will be.\nIt won't always be the same.\nThough I wanted it to be.\nIt won't always be the same.\nWhen laughs have become eery.\nIt won't always be the same.\nEverything reminds me.\nIt won't always be the same.\nThe light now casts darkness.\nIt won't always be the same.\nWas same until we were friends.\nIt won't always be the same.\nThe roses begun to die now.\nIt won't always be the same.\nYet we don't know how.\nIt won't always be the same.\nThe history to be buried.\nIt won't always be the same.\nBut it only did repeat.\nIt won't always be the same.\nWords back then and they are now.\nIt won't always be the same.\nLove back then and it is now.\nIt won't always be the same.\nBecause the writers didn't agree.\nIt won't always be the same.\nLike the book I have to bury.\nIt won't always be the same.\nI pushed it hard to be.\nIt won't always be the same.\nLike nothing has ever been.\nIt won't always be the same.\nLike the times I used to think how.\nIt won't always be the same.\nBecause picking flowers kill them now.\nIt won't always be the same.\nThe gifts now fill me with rage.\nIt won't always be the same.\nSince we are not in the same page.\nIt won't always be the same.\nThe \"genys\" are now what I have.\nIt won't always be the same.\nOnly one in us two can be sad.\nIt won't always be the same.\nThe ink doesn't flow with care.\nIt won't always be the same.\nThe jokes made turned into dares.\nIt won't always be the same.\nFrom symbiotes to paracites.\nIt won't always be the same.\nRoses and cares to slaps and fights.\nIt won't always be the same.\nLike spears of words that you threw.\nIt won't always be the same.\nWere you right?

Thought we were allowed to modify the product on our end but not distribute it. Well, we were doing that and were happy with it. And what about the legality of checking the user's system individually, but it's expected now, you guys even forgot your first motto and even removed \"Don't be evil.\" from you code of conduct.\n\n\nRemoving dislike counter was a pretty bold move, wow! We heard your explanation \"Some people were getting harassed by the dislike spammers.\" who are these \"some people\" here? You yourself? Because the last YouTube rewind was prolly the most disliked video till you removed the counter. You made our life harder by removing a perfect metric to know if the video was worth watching or not.\n\n\nAdd to queue behind paywall? Why? Why even put a perfectly fine feature that was enjoyed by the non premium users for ages suddenly behind the paywall? I have only seen it as a premium feature in mobile but I don't think it'll take you long to put it behind even on the website.\n\n\nMultiple, queued and un-skippable ads. I don't even want to talk about them! I don't even know if any other platform has this kind of ad system.\n\n\nStart to shorts directly? This gets me furious!

The ecall instruction is a special instruction used to delegate processing to the kernel. When the ecall instruction is executed, an exception handler is called, and control is transferred to the kernel. The return value from the kernel is set in the a0 register.\nThe first systemcall implemented is putchar. It takes a character as the first argument and the second and subsequent unused arguments are set to 0.\nThen the ecall instruction is handled in the kernel. The calling of ecall can by determined by checking the value of scause. Before calling the handle_syscall function we also add the size of ecall instruction (4) to the value of sepc.\nThis is because sepc points to the program counter that caused the exception, which points to the ecall instruction. If we don't change it, the kernel goes back to the same place, and the ecall instruction is executed repeatedly.\nThen a system call  handler is made and is called from trap handler. It receives a\nstructure of registers at the time of exception that was saved in the trap handler. It determined the type of system call by checking the value of a3 register.\nThe system call was then tested with a main print function in shell.c.\nAn exit system call is also implemented where it takes the first argument as 3 which is defined as SYS_EXIT.\nThe system call changes the process state to PROC_EXITED, and calls yield to give up the CPU to other processes. The scheduler will only execute processes in PROC_RUNNABLE state, so it will never return to this process. However, PANIC macro is added to cause a panic in case it does return.\nA bare-bones shell was then implemented to use the syscalls to perform actions from the user mode.\n","id":"https://scientiac.space/syndications/kl-os-2026-01-03/","title":"KL-OS: System Call"},"https://scientiac.space/syndications/kl-os-2026-01-04/":{"body":"\nDay 14 was about Disk I/O.\nA device driver for the virtio-blk, a virtual disk device was implemented.\nVirtio is one of the APIs for device drivers to control devices. It is widely used in virtualization environments such as QEMU.\nThe virtio devices have a structure called virtqueue and it is a queue shared between the driver and the device.\nIt consists of Discriptor Table, Available Ring and Used Ring.\nFirst we enable virtio drivers in our buildscript which is run.sh. We use the following flags for qemu:\n\nHere, lorem.txt is a file made for testing purposes beforehand.\nThen, the definition of c structs and macros is done in kernel.h.

It contains file contents, filenames, creation dates, and other information necessary for a filesystem. Compared to common filesystem formats like FAT or ext2, tar has a much simpler data structure.\nFirst a simple directory with two files is made as an example which is then archived/compressed into the tar format using the command line tar tool. Which, also is added to the buildscript before launching the qemu VM.\n\nTo read the filesystem, first, the data structures related to the tar filesystem is defined in kernel.h. This implementation has all files read from the disk at boot.\nTo write to the disk, the contents of the files variable is written back to the disk in the tar file format. The files variable contains the copy of the disk variable declared as a static variable (It is a temporary buffer and, since the stack has a limited size it is preferred to use static variable instead of local stack variable.) which contains the disk image.\nFile read/write system calls are then designed in the user.c and user.h files and then the system calls are implemented on the kernel files and then the system calls are implemented in the kernel. We also add the read and write commands to the shell.\nBut, we still have to address the user pointers.\nIn RISC-V, the behaviour of S-Mode (kernel) can be configured through sstatus CSR, including SUM (permit Supervisor User Memory access) bit. When SUM is not set, S-Mode programs (i.e. kernel) cannot access U-Mode (user) pages.\nAll we need to do is to set the SUM bit when entering user space and voila!

One's beliefs can be drastically different from the other and yet none would listen to the other and look at it from their perspective as well. Humans have evolved learning things and passing the technique that helped them survive to the new generation, so it isn't a big deal to assume that they survived fine with those beliefs, and it is far optimal to pass on that belief than to gamble with new opinions.\nAnyway, I hope it doesn't just remain as a new term in my vocabulary.

Like, look at how DALL.E could generate images a few years back and how it generates images in the current state.\nSo, yeah! We don't know a person within a month or even an year or a lifetime because knowing is only predicting what the other mind would think and it's constantly changing and evolving.
