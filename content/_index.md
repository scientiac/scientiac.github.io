Hello! I am Scientiac. I welcome you in my fun little corner of the internet where I share my thoughts and write about things I like.

## My hobbies and interests

As a student, currently studying computer engineering I love computers obviously, but beyond that I like gazing at the stars and writing literature. More on computers and software, I use Linux and I do feel like I cannot live without it. I have come to learn about privacy on the internet, so I love using [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) whenever possible.

## About this site...

This site is built with the [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) static site generator. Taking inspirations from my fellow friends from the [fediverse](https://fediverse.party/en/fediverse/); [Kev Quirk](https://kevquirk.com/), [Benjamin Hollon](https://benjaminhollon.com/), [Joel Chrono](https://joelchrono12.xyz/) and reading their thoughts on what a blogging website should feel like, I have created this beautiful website focused on the reading experience than design. 

[Readable CSS](https://readable-css.freedomtowrite.org/) is the base CSS of my site and [LaTeX Fonts](https://latex.vercel.app/) are the preferred fonts.
