_**I welcome you to one of my successful experiments: blogging regularly**; that I started near the end of 2020.
My writings have shifted and fluctuated over the years, but this started as a way to share my poems. These days
I mostly write about the things I try and have fun with (and also poems)._

_My name's `σπανδαν`, I go by `scιεnτιαc` or `iac` on the internet. I am studying _Computer Engineering_ with the aim
of understanding computers and how they actually function (which is almost an impossible task if you look at it from a high level)._

## Colophon

I built this site to be readable and customizable while being minimal. It has become more and more complex (relatively)
over the years under the hood though. I use the [LaTeX Fonts](https://latex.vercel.app/) as the preferred Fonts
and use [Readable CSS](https://readable-css.freedomtowrite.org/) as the base to my styles.
I have used [zola](https://www.getzola.org/) as the static site generator and `github` actions do the heavy lifting of
building the site, then [Sending](https://webmention.app/), and [Receiving](https://webmention.io/) webmentions.
This site also complies with the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) guidelines.

### A little More

_Most of the things I build that still work are the things
I regularly use in my daily life. I am a chronic Linux user and a FOSS advocate and I like to learn new skills but mostly 
end up giving up very early in the process. If you don't already know, I love computers. But apart from that I love art, science, stars, and humans(also animals and also birds, and words)._  

_That's almost everything I'll tell you here ( not really <kbd>;)</kbd>), I'll definitely like you if you meet me in person. See you around!_
