Using linux coming from windows is like, talking in a different language. You try to use your grammar with their words (making it an accent) and you feel difficult communicating. 

And saying linux is harder to use than windows is like speaking <insert foreign language here> is harder than speaking <insert your language here>. 

Live in the place for some time and instead of worrying about the language, you think about the services, products and lifestyle the place offers.
