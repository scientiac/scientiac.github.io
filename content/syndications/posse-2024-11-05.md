Indieweb is such a cool place. And the fact that you have webrings and 
webmentions makes it the most open and custom social media. The possibility of interactions and replies adds beauty with convenience to this unique form of communication.

I just love it. Thanks [@aaronpk](https://aaronparecki.com/2018/06/30/11/your-first-webmention) for the tests.
