The KDE Network is a group of KDE representatives in their respective cities/countries promoting KDE, and itâ€™s work in their local community. Additionally, they are responsible for helping to grow the community, and to act as a liaison between their local community and KDE.

This is what I found when going through KDE wiki wondering how KDE as a community was structured. Seeing there were not many local groups listed, I wanted to contribute by forming a group here in Nepal. Hence, the introduction event with megarelease celebration.
