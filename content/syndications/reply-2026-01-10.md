I see that you yourself have a `URL/Permalink` input field to send mentions, mine is the same. And it is only for the ones who haven't [automated sending](https://webmention.app/docs#using-the-command-line) them in their site building pipeline.

It is only there as an option. In case the automation fails or is not set up.
