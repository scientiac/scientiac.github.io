Sometimes I want to hurt (not physically) people (when I am disappointed or dissatisfied).
To maybe let them know that I am hurt (I know I Know it's the wrong way).

I'd do things that would hurt me, to hurt them, but it hurts me back when they don't feel a thing when the thing would have hurt me.
Call it a weakness, call it "doesn't make sense" but at last the one who gets hurt is the one who tried to hurt people (not those who hurt people).
