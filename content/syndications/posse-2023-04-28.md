I kinda binged fleabag and it was quite awesome. It's more of a six-hour movie than a show, I'd say. I had watched season 1 and season 2 wasn't difficult to finish. This is one of those series which I hated the first season, and it made my mind with the second. It's a masterpiece as it ended with an actual ending and wasn't extended due to public demand or just money.

Yeah! The fact that it ended is my second favorite thing about the show.
