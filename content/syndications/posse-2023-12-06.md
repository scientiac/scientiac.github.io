I'm back home from Kathmandu. This time it was an event from GNOME; the GNOME.Asia 2023. There were poeple from Fedora, GNOME, Phosh form different parts of world ; USA, Indonesia, India in Kathmandu, Nepal for a conference about FOSS. It was quite an event. Also, got to contribute to fedora by eating the 20th anniversary cake tooðŸ˜‰, there should really be a badge for "has eaten fedora cake" in fedora badges. 

It was a very fun and educational experience. I realize that the people in FOSS are generally very generous, friendly and helpful.
