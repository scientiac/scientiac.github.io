I bought a new laptop. It's Zenbook 14 OLED 2024, Ryzen 7 8840HS and well it came with Windows Home preinstalled as expected. I had never really daily drived windows. I had installed linux the first day I got my first laptop. Soooo, I am giving windows a try, it's been some days and I haven't used that many applicaitons.

I have installed firefox and given it a nice css makeover, then I installed NixOS-WSL and set that as the default terminal and ported my terminal home manager config with git, bash, starship, and other tools over to it. And that's all, I guess i will use the linux terminal and the windows GUI for some days now.
