I came across a [blog](https://collabfund.com/blog/mental-liquidity/) post about Mental Liquidity, and it got me into thinking how people do not want to change their mind, especially when it comes to generationally gapped individuals. One's beliefs can be drastically different from the other and yet none would listen to the other and look at it from their perspective as well. Humans have evolved learning things and passing the technique that helped them survive to the new generation, so it isn't a big deal to assume that they survived fine with those beliefs, and it is far optimal to pass on that belief than to gamble with new opinions.

Anyway, I hope it doesn't just remain as a new term in my vocabulary. I believe that one should be able to change their mind on things, change my mind!
