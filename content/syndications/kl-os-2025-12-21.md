I want to learn systems programming and I thought why not go with the open source one which is currency in development. 
So, I chose the RISC-V architecture.
That way if I decide to keep pursuing it, I can grow along with the ISA slowly catching up to it.

I want to keep a streak by posting here every day about what I learn. Let's hope it goes well.
