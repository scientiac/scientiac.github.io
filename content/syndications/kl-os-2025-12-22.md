I have set up the environment required to run RISC-V 64 toolchain using `QEMU`.

Installed a `debian` RISC-V 64 `iso` and set it up to my liking with `autologin` and proper terminal emulation and `sudo`. I then installed `gcc`, `gdb` and `neovim` for writing and compiling programs.

Details of what happened on [Day 1](https://codeberg.org/scientiac/KL-OS/src/branch/main/progress/day-1.md) is tracked using `git` with `codeberg` as a remote.

I have decided to use [Operating System in 1000 Lines](https://operating-system-in-1000-lines.vercel.app/) as the learning material because it was featured as a beginner level learning material in [github:riscv/learn](https://github.com/riscv/learn).
