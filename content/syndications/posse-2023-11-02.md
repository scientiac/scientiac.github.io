I'm not much of a gamer and haven't gamed in a very long time even on mobile which was the only thing I had before I got my laptop.  Also, being a tinkerer, I spent most of my time tinkering with my Linux system and android custom ROMs.

Today I felt like I was missing out a lot and kinda wanted to game. Gave it a quick search and found "Hollow Knight" which seems like my type of game so I purchased it on steam. Might as well call it my first desktop game. It feels special.
