I have tears in my eyes, hearing that ingenuity is dead, but not fully dead. First she just shocks everyone by living more than we anticipated her to, and now she is dead because she can no longer do what she went there to do. But, still alive that she's doing work that she wasn't even assigned to do, with broken wings and muddy eyes.
