I have multiple blogs now, and multiple sections on my blog. This is also a blog and I do have my monthly long form blog in this site, which might be a poem, a story, an article or a report but I also have flux on [flux.carboxi.de](https://flux.carboxi.de) where I write more frequently about my daily thoughts.

So, this is what I have decided for now:

1. The long form blog in this site is to give the best of my month to it.
2. The syndication here is very minute posts I want to just make and federate.
3. Flux is where I write (almost) regularly but it resembles what I am thinking about that day.
