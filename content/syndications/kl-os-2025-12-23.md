The actual development of OS started with making the build script `run.sh` in bash to setup and launch a `qemu` RISC-V virtual machine with `OpenSBI` as bios for QEMU.

Then a linker script `kernel.ld` was made and a basic kernel process `kernel.c` was written. Finally, the build script was updated to include compiler and execution commands and flags to properly boot the kernel.

[Day 2](https://codeberg.org/scientiac/KL-OS/src/branch/main/progress/day-2.md) focused on writing a basic starting process of a kernel and running it in a virtual machine.
