Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! This is one of those hot takes on "Love" ooOooh!!

Human nature is weird. Like, how someone would behave when they feel like they're loved and how the behavior would change when they feel like they are indifferent to them. It's quite fascinating that the behavioral and psychological pattern change, how cute turns into offensive and feelings turn into conscious infatuation. Apparently hope plays quite a big role in it. One could argue that "love" is nothing but just hopefulness. And when one gets hopeless, everybody knows how that goes. 

This is neither a paper nor a thesis, it's just my take on love today. So, I suppose it's better incomplete and a hot take than a "WHAT I SAY IS ALWAYS TRUE" of a vibe. Bye!
