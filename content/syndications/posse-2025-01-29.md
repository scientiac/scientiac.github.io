I once called myself an optimist. 

But since negativity has started seeping in, it has become very difficult to focus on the positives, not even for people who ( is, are ) would have been loved if it wasn't for that negativity ( pride, ego, narcisicim, misogeny, misandry, .... ).

I won't trust me for how I describe people, and won't trust anyone but myself to really know one. And neither should you. I suggest you create a picture of a person on your own and not from someone else's description or bias.

This won't change the people who I say are are bad to not be bad, but verifying it is essential. Thank you.
