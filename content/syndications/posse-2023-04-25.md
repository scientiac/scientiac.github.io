So, this is the mini-blog thingy that I was planning to make for some time now. And maybe I'll share my thoughts following POSSE (Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere) and share the link to this to everywhere else. I have an RSS feed for this, which I'll try to use for fetching and scripting if needed and anybody can just use it normally as intended as well.
