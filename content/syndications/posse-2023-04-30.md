Yes! The freshman year is over now. And I already feel like I have more responsibilities than usual. It feels good for some time until the feeling that you're getting old hits you. This year passed with a blink of an eye, I remember getting inside the college and feeling exited about what I was going to be. Let's see how the life as a middle child in the college goes. Wow! Three more binks and I'll be a graduate, it's scary.
