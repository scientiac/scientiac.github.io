Perfect topic for today because early morning I was shown why It was a stupid decision to do something, then at afternoon I got into a bike accident. Though it was minor with no injuries to both parties except some scratches on the bikes. It could have caused huge consequences. Then I did another mistake and then another.

PANIC!

It is [day 5](https://codeberg.org/scientiac/KL-OS/src/branch/main/progress/day-5.md). Implementing panic was very easy, it is implemented as a macro because if we defined it as a function it would have printed the `__LINE__` and `__FILE__` where `PANIC` is defined and not where it is called. And to halt the kernel it uses a `while true` loop which goes on infinitely.
