So, Scar was suffering from depression, after all he had the pressure of becoming a king, and yet he wasn't trained, cared, taught, loved....(As described in the story.). Why did Mufasa not understand and forgive him and let him be the part of the family (While he was once lost and alone too.)?

Spoiler Alert: He wanted the villain to its sequel.
