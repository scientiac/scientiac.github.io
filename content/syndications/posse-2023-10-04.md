3rd Semester of Computer Engineering is over now, and the vacation starts. This time, like all the semester endings, I have a lot of ideas and plans in mind and I hope to complete at least some of them if not all. Last vacation I looked into the Rust book and this holidays I want to try making a project in rust. 

The other thing is that I switched from Fedora to NixOS, the Nix language and the OS's declerativeness has gotten me interested in Haskell and functional paradigm in general. Also, lambda calculus, currying, monads and other concepts originated from functional paradigm are very interesting.

I hope to learn something flashy✨, something technical⚙ and something unique❄️ this holiday.
