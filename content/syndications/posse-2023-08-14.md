I like the initiative by GitHub to bring like-minded people of tech in a single place by organising un-conferences around the globe. On one hand, I am excited to meet people like me but on the other hand, it's GitHub(Microsoft) whose product I will become as the saying goes "If you aren't paying for the product, you are the product".

Anyways, meeting my people is more important and about being a product, that should be handled strategically. I'll try to include other git hosting platforms like gitlab, codeberg and forgejo whenever I say the word GitHub, think that's more healthy.
