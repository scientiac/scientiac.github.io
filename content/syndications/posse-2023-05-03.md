`dō-mān′`  

</center>

1. A territory over which rule or control is exercised.
2. A sphere of activity, influence, or knowledge: synonym: field.
3. The set of all possible values of an independent variable of a function.
4. An open connected set that contains at least one point.

Yep! I have my own domain now. My own territory, my own space, [scientiac.space](https://scientiac.space).
