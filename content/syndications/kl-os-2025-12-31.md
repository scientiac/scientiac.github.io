[Day 10](https://codeberg.org/scientiac/KL-OS/src/branch/main/progress/day-10.md) was about testing and debugging paging and page table contents. 

Running the `buildscript` should give us the exact same output of repeating letters similar to how it was before paging was implemented.

Then the page table contents were examined. To check about the registers, following command was run on the `qemu` console.

```sh 
(qemu) info registers
```

Then the value of `satp` register is read and then interpreted by doing the following hexadecimal math:

```py 
hex((0x<val of satp> & 0x3fffff) * 4096)
```

Then the `VPN[1]` and `VPN[0]` physical addressed were also examined.

The consequences of forgetting to set the paging mode, specifying physical address instead of physical page number was also seen. `qemu` logs were also enabled.
