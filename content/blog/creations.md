In the inception  
  
I created god,  
gave it magic,  
made it to exist in every forms.  
  
I created heaven,  
gave it beauty,  
made it an epitome of happiness.  
  
I created soul,  
inserted it in my body,  
gave it the power to control life.  
  
In the end  
  
God created me,  
bounded me in laws,  
made me die in every cost.  
  
Heaven created hell,  
it fried me in oil,  
tortured all and always gave pain.  
  
Soul conquered body,  
controlled me no matter when,  
used and threw me away, after then.
