Some mistakes I fix myself.  
And others I don't want to fix.  
Those mistakes I find myself.  
And others, resonate from noise.  
  
I try doing things my way.  
And others are forced on me.  
Those things I understand.  
And others, they go in vain.  
  
Asking questions I learn a lot.  
Other things are (m.a)ed to try.  
Now I play with: Force = m.a  
And others, I just know, don't ask!  
  
These days I just listen, no talk.  
Runners teaching toddlers to walk.  
And I think they should let them fall.  
Other times, I know that's love.  
  
Showing faults, is not what they like.  
It's kinda like training wheels on a bike.  
I know generally medicines are bitter.  
Don't forget some poisons are sweeter.
