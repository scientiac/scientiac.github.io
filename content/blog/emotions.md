## A poem written by two different brains with different emotions.  
Incharge, I thought I was,  
thought I could control them.  
Soo bad, was I soo wrong,  
couldn't see when they came.  
  
Swiftly, they came by and got stuck,  
thought they'll pass by and not stay.  
Warm and subtle, they lured their way,  
I fear I might be the one standing at bay.  
  
Shocked, I was to then know,  
how those began to then grow.  
Scared, that's all I was now,  
hide them? or, shall I show.  
  
Dilemma, you ask? that might not just justify,  
for I could decide but still not be bold.  
Sunshines and storms, it slowly spoke sense.  
Let it go or have faith and hold?  
  
Worried, I tend to cry sometimes,  
though my heart, warm it feels.  
Defeated, from all these norms,  
I bow to them and then I kneel.  
  
Longing, because it always feels home,  
but sometimes I wish I had a shield.  
Quarrels and conquers, looking for win.  
Somewhere, I know, I have to yield.
