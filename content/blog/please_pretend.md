I pretend to be an expert,  
I pretend to be a master,  
just pretend to do the work,  
And pretend to not suck.  
  
I pretend to be good,  
I pretend to be loved,  
then pretend that I can ace,  
and pretend like I am the best.  
  
I pretend to love you,  
I pretend to be fun,  
yet pretend to hear you talk,  
and pretend that you rock.  
  
I pretend that I'm happy,  
I pretend to smile, a lot!  
so pretend that I am optimistic,  
and pretend that I'm not sick.  
  
I pretend to be a friend,  
I pretend like I'm a helping hand,  
therefore pretend to be so nice,  
And pretend like I am as wise.  
  
You think I wish good for you,  
I pretend like I am with you,  
You think I dont hate your view,  
I pretend like I like that too.  
  
You think I want to see you smile,  
and think I bring the good of vibes,  
I just pretend to be the man,  
that you think helps till he can.  
  
You think what I say is true?  
It's soo not what I see in you,  
I just pretend how good you are,  
killing your picture made by ears.  
  
You think that 'I' is a poet,  
I pretend that it's I who is,  
But that's as wrong as it can get,  
It's everyone, you'll see, just wait.  
  
I see you think your view is pure,  
you treat the ones like they deserve,  
oh! I think they are not so bad,  
Pretend! You'll see the good they have.  
  
### Just pretend you're good to them and you'll see the good in them as well.
