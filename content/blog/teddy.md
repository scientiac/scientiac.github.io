As a poet, I am not ready.  
Hurts my brain trying to rhyme teddy.  
Maybe something related to lady?  
Writing this poem, I'm going crazy.  
Just buy a teddy and give it to your baby.  
Heck buy a barbie and surprise her maybe?  
Completing this poem is making me hungry.  
Now, all I can think is about chicken gravy.
