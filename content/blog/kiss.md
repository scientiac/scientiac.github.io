<div style="text-align: left">

I had forgotten the world.  
Didn't know what's real from fake.  
I trusted all of you.  
Never realizing that it was a mistake.  
I treated you like my soul.  
Not knowing the taste of heartbreak.  
I gave you all of me and more.  
Clearly unknown about what was at stake.  

I wanted to see you happy.  
But, the efforts kept making me weak.  
I listened to all your stories.  
Many nights I didn't sleep.  
I gave you all my secrets.  
Of mistakes made, that I'd rather die with.  
I used to wish that you'd know me.  
Before knowing that our dream was just a myth.  

I let you rule my mind.  
Didn't suspect a bit, of what was making me sick.  
I didn't care about myself.  
From you, I learned what was narcissistic.  
I have finally cracked the code.  
Now I know, that it was all a trick.  
I had never suspected a thing.  
Hallucinating to the taste of your lipstick.
