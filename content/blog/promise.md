What could have been if promises were enforced?  
A price to pay for every broken promises.  
Would people still make them and take them lifelong.  
Promises will be extinct, if I know the people where I'm from.  
Where I'm from, people would die if they made promises.  
People will cry from all the punishments.  
Only the bravest could make a promise,  
with no bad intentions, who's disciplined and honest.  

Looking at a mirror, I have made my fair share.  
Most have been broken while some are safe.  
When I think about my promises, it fills me with rage.  
Writing poems to calm down is just one of the ways.  
For me, the cost of a promise was rage and pain.  
Lost some of myself that now I cannot gain.  
A promise can make a bond so strong, that's unheard of.  
But, don't you dare make a promise when you know you can not love.
