<div style="text-align: left">

I'll keep you warm, I'll tuck you tight.  
You'll never want to leave.  

You'll lose track of time, you'll realize.  
My love is addictive.  

I'll hold your hands, I'll make you dance.  
You'll want me even more.  

You'll compete with me, you'll want to win.  
On who loves whom the most.  

  
We'll go on a walk, I'll make you laugh.  
You'll forget your way back home.  

You'll want me to rest, stick me to your chest.  
And kiss me on your own.  

I won't just try, I'll never lie.  
You'll miss me when I'm far.  

You'll want me so bad, that you'll start,  
wishing me to the stars.  


I'll be your man, and by your side.  
In sadness and hard times.  

When you are sad, I'll make you sleep.  
With my lullabies and rhymes.  

I'll keep you awake, we'll talk all night.  
Out future and past lives.  

You'll share with me, the secrets you keep.  
Beyond mere truth and lies.  


I'm always there, for you in need.  
You'll always have a friend.  

You'll think of me, and the things we did.  
Hoping it never ends.  

I wish to give, a gift so sweet.  
You'd wish that you were mine.  

A hug so firm, and full of love.  
It transcends space and time.
