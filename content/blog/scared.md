I'm too scared, and it is not my fault.  
Choosing these words, became difficult.  
  
Minor details, I've begun to care for.  
Never satisfied, wish I'd be there more.  
  
I feel disabled, to be there for you.  
Behind screens, pretending to care you.  
  
I think about it a lot, before I say.  
All possibilities and the correct way.  
  
My thoughts, they conquer all my time.  
Present, old past, new future of mine.  
  
Right answers, I've been searching for.  
What I am searching is wrong, I fear.  
  
I say things, and think that I mean it.  
They just remain words, out of my limits.  
  
The future, possibilities of you and me.  
All gathers inside, into scary feelings.
