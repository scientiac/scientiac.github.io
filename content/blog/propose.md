<em>
<div style="text-align: left">

Should I state the truth or just follow.  
Fluffy coat around my heart that's hollow.  
Follow the rainbow just to see your eyes glow?  
I'll give you my truth and let the tears fall low. 

I'm not sure if it's an ask or you're telling.  
I wonder if it's a want or you're just wishing.  
You had to get it out. Was it really killing?  
I doubt that it was more than just a feeling.  

With a box of chocolate and a bouquet or a rose,
teasing your chances for a small love dose.
No matter the story, the end had to hurt us.
Choosing to propose someone lacking a purpose.

</div>
