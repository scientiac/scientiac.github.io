Deeds of blood that villains pump keep all books alive.
Never are things, clear they seem, looking through the eyes.
When I see a problem solved, rule books see me wrong.
Amidst the people, ones who get me, is where I belong.

What I have, an evil twin, deep beneath my heart,
Takes control, shreds you apart; dare not push too hard.
Your world is the same as mine; thorns where roses grow.
Black and white of your grays is what I try to show.

Neither good nor am I bad; it's just what you see.
Can't I show, and you didnâ€™t see, what I deemed to be.
I'll try to die and die happy, teaching how not to go.
I'm sorry I failed to be what the world wanted me to show.
