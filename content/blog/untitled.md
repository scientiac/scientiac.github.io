Poems, the way I speak.   
Eyes, they talk but weak.   
Gestures, that's all I'll give.   
I've always been like this, so, believe.   
  
Words, I just write them.   
Fourth, like I always came.   
Resist, all my feelings, then.   
All those thoughts, in my brain.   
  
Times, it has been many.   
Rhymes, if I found any.   
Chimes, my heartbeat makes.   
Just three words, that's all it takes.   
  
Fine, like I always am.   
Smile, I was programmed.   
Clear, it's like a diagram.   
Life tests us, it's an exam.   
  
Shine, it's my turn to.   
Crime, would be to not do.  
Perfect, though I seem blue.   
I have to hide, with no clue.   
  
Heart, it's always been soft.   
Sweet, like I have always loved.   
Fighting, though, I've been idled.   
Like life, this poem, everything's untitled.
