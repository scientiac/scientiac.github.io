### Synopsis

> A room, a pen and a keyboard.  
> Poems, they're just assumptions.  
> Today, I'm out from my comfort.  
> And I observed my surrounds.....    
  
I saw a woman, talking with her dog.   
It too jumped, and went for a hug.   
Saw a man, a very huge load.   
Dust, rough clothes, in a graveled road.   
A girl riding her scooter, gliding through air.  
Didn't have a helmet, wind flowing her hair.  
In many people, common was a single thing.   
Smiling they were, happy they seemed.   
My assumptions were wrong, I was blind.   
Happiness was, just, a state of mind.  
Though It may, It's transferred from things.   
Dog to the woman, way to the man.  
And the scooter, that was her charm.  
Something seemed off, a false positive.  
My data gave results, somewhat relative.  
It's what I saw, I here am the proof.   
I saw a grandma, praying on her roof.  
Seeing her face, there was a smile.   
Why was she happy? I thought for a while.  
My data has shown, and it's not wrong.   
Hope was the key, the proof was strong.  
It comes to me, times I used to hope.   
Happy I was, no reason to sob.  
Me, my questions, all starting from "how?".   
The realizations, they are, all I have now.
