<em>

It's a list of order that you cannot touch.  
Some BID, Some QD but never too much.  
If L status drops, PRN increase the doses.  
Always test the stats with a bouquet of roses.  

Treat the patient with nourishment and a gentle care.  
Don't stop the treatment till the speech is fully clear.  
Remember this advice, before taking part in a fight.  
Never miss the endearments, no matter day or night.  

Trust the procedure and follow the protocol.  
Make sure to keep her VS steady and normal.  
Talk a little less but keep listening to her rambles.  
Don't put too much effort, just be kind and humble.
