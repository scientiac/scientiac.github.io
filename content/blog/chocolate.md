<div style="text-align: left">

Never doubt the power of something sweet.  
Intoxicates your mind till you cannot quit.  

White lies in it to make you feel better.  
You'll learn to love it, even when it's bitter.  

Glitters in the wrapper, with a price to pay.  
It's always worth it. It'll make you say.  

Reasoning consumption, is an unpopular opinion.  
Following trends like a bunch of minions.  

It's never true that something is always bad.  
Even death's pretty, losing something you once had.  

I'm so desperate, I don't even fear death.  
In my deathbed, bring me a bag of chocolate.

</div>
