Stars in the heaven,  
blazing like the burning flames.  
Glowing, sparkling and twinkling.  
  
Aurora in the sky,  
exquisite like a vivid rainbow.  
Raven-like, mysterious and enchanting.  
  
Snowy golden clouds,  
lustrous like the shiny crystals.  
Icy, misty and sparkling.  
  
Clean sand dunes,  
bloomed like the cactus flowers.  
Beautiful, fierce and brown.  
  
Waves in the ocean,  
clear like the flowing water.  
Shining, shimmeringÂ  and simple.  
  
The universe in her eyes,  
is where I experience nirvana.
