It's about us both  
Maybe, it's not  
Maybe It's only about me  
It's about how I followed you  
How I loved you  
How we were together  
How I felt when you disappeared  
Wait,  
Maybe its all about you  
About how you didn't notice me  
How you lived your life flying and playing  
How you didn't care  
How you enjoyed the day and night  
How I didn't matter  
Or  
Maybe its about them  
About how they made fun of us  
How they made us different  
How they manipulated our mind  
How they used us both  
How they took us apart  
Clearly  
This was a heaven  
A heaven of hope  
Where you were a firefly  
An innocent little beauty  
Where I was the night  
Dark cold and empty  
And they were the rain  
A cruel endless rain       
Because,  
We were destined to meet tomorrow.  
A new day with a new hope  
Where I hoped to meet you  
See you dancing  
In your own small world  
but all that's left was hope  
Not just any hope  
But a false hope  
A hope that broke my heart  
A hope which hid the pain of truth  
A hope that was toxic  
A hope which pushed me  
Far from your presence  
Far far away from you  
Far from the world of fireflies  
Far far away from my firefly.
