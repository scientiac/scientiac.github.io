Flowing water.  
Sparkling droplets forming rainbow,  
dispersing light from white to colors.  
The sound of yours give me different feelings;  
a feeling of satisfaction, relaxation.  
A feeling that can put me to sleep.  
You flow with a unpredictable turbulence,  
bouncing and breaking into droplets.  
Droplets that go everywhere, anywhere.  
Sometimes you drown me   
maybe others too drown inside you.  
Never steady and ever changing,  
You may just me a point in time  
or might be a whole life to me.  
I can't be far from you  
neither can I be near you.  
You are heavenly and beautiful as hell  
or are you nature's weapon of destruction.  
It's just in your nature to be anything,  
make your own paths and explore.  
New directions new ways  
like the flow of  electrons of an atom.  
'Uncertain!'  
And I,  am just an antelope  
quenching my thirst in a puddle,  
beside the Waterfall.
