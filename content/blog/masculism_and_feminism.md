> I would like to apologize for the very clickbaity title. This is what it takes to be heard in the internet.

In our rapidly evolving world, the concepts of feminism and patriarchy have become increasingly polarizing topics. However, it's crucial to consider the existence of alternative perspectives, such as masculism and matriarchy, which offer equally valid viewpoints in this context. As a humanist, I believe that men and women should view each other as complementary pieces of a whole, functioning together, kinda like plants which have both male and female organs in the same body.

The natural differences between male and female in humans are not as extreme as in some species, where male bees die after mating or female spiders are consumed by their offspring. While individual humans have unique personalities, strengths, and weaknesses, neither males nor females are complete without the other. Historically, we have coexisted for the sake of offspring and family.

It's important to recognize that traditional gender roles, where females solely care for children and males exclusively work or hunt, are not the only viable arrangement. Both caring for children and earning a living are equally necessary, and these responsibilities should be shared based on individual abilities and circumstances. Suppressing one gender from their potential is counterproductive; instead, we should foster understanding between partners and organize our efforts intellectually to create a balanced approach to living, caring, and raising offspring.

My analysis of internet content, particularly on platforms like YouTube, reveals a troubling trend. As a male, I've noticed that I'm often exposed to male-oriented content, which can lead to increasingly extremist views portraying men as "right" and women as trying to "win at everything." Conversely, women may be exposed to equally polarizing content depicting men as oppressors, killers, and rapists. This divisive approach creates an "us vs. them" mentality, where each side views the other through an extremist lens.

The media's focus on controversial and extreme content, driven by the pursuit of attention and profit, has contributed to this polarization. However, I believe that no sane, educated person is inherently an oppressor or oppressed in a relationship. Most reasonable men support equal rights and opportunities for women. Labeling entire groups as weak or strong is unscientific and counterproductive.

As humans, we have achieved remarkable technological and scientific advancements through proper planning and reasoning. It's essential to question outdated ways of thinking and embrace new truths as they emerge. Prioritizing one gender over another in the name of culture, especially when scientific evidence contradicts such practices, hinders human progress.

However, it's also important to recognize that new ways of thinking aren't always entirely correct. For instance, pornography, while introducing many people to sex and reproduction, has created unrealistic expectations and unhealthy influences on relationships where people are no longer being stimulated by "normal" and getting into extremes which might have caused in an increase in rape and child abuse cases. Similarly, social media has fostered insecurities about lifestyle, body image, and personal appearance by presenting an idealized version of life that makes people feel inadequate and might be the cause of depression and anxiety feeling worthless and never enough.

> That being said the causes of child abuse, rape cases and an existance of countless supressed voices of victims isn't only by extreme porn but also a sense of authority of some males in the society who actually are opressors and think they can get away with anything or the arrogant confidence that "nobody will believe" they have done such things. 

> I once had asked my friend about what could have caused these cases where men get away of doing such cruel deeds and she said, "Our society is largely run by men. Most positions of power – be it in government, corporations, or law enforcement – are occupied by men. This creates a system where men in authority might be inclined to protect other men accused of wrongdoing. They may downplay the severity of crimes, question the credibility of victims, or find ways to shift blame onto the affected parties. This pattern often leads to a conclusion that somehow excuses the perpetrator or suggests the victim is partially responsible for what happened to them." which I think is true.

I long for a society that supports and uplifts everyone, regardless of gender, physiology, or biology. A culture where people help each other overcome weaknesses instead of using them as grounds for oppression. By working together, we can solve problems that we as individuals cannot tackle alone and for that we have to remove the extreme catagorization of people soley based on sex or race. Because in the world where no two people are alike I don't think that catagorization solves any issue.

> Perhaps reality is more neutral, and I dont know what I am talking about because the internet is where I live and I consume what it offers. I just hope that we are heading toward a better future where the differences of people isn't a problem but our strength.

## Lastly...

I was very scared to publish this in the internet, but, it's crucial to address these complex societal issues. They don't have easy solutions, but open dialogue is a vital step towards understanding the world we inhabit.

This post is just the beginning of a larger conversation. I eagerly anticipate your responses and insights, as I recognize there's still much for me to learn.
