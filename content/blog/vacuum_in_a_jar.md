Sometimes, my poems start with "sometimes".  
Those sometimes I cry.  
Time, I do always write about it.  
No grasp, but I try.  
Crimes, I think I'll commit one once.  
Fear shadows those thoughts.  
Prays, though I feel like an atheist.  
Please ignore it, gods.  
Slaves, what I think we all become.  
To things, we think we want.  
Poem, no, it's just a disguised story.  
One of the many ones.  
A story, with no end, or a beginning.  
It's of a different kind.  
Stress, my only cause of disappointment.  
And It's a long line.  
Love, I thought, could handle it well.  
Foolish! I was wrong.  
Reason, It's not you or the system over us.  
It was me all along.  
Scared, I thought that I can't ever be.  
Cause you always were behind.  
Empty, I always am, I need some more time.  
With no one but you as mine.  
Story, I am trying to write about love.  
Sadness is what occurred.  
Fear, if not? What might be love, then?  
Of breaking someone's heart.  
  
Maybe it's time, I need to change.  
I'll tell you the things I see till range.  
  
I see you as vacuum in a jar.  
Of space that I love.  
Much care and love to it.  
You don't get to sob.  
  
Surrounded by the forces.  
Atmosphere, enemy of yours.  
It's me, yes! I am the jar.  
I won't break, pushes I endure.  
  
There's no cure, once a hole.  
Nothing will be the same, I'm sure.  
Delicate and vulnerable, oh you!  
A story for my emptiness, you're pure.
