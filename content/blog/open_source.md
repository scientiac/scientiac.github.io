## How a clean, secure, reliable, honest and better software is created.

Open source is source code that is made freely available to be modified by the public as well as can be redistributed. It is a decentralized software development model that encourage people for open collaboration. It began as a response to the limitation and weakness of the "closed source" proprietary code. 

Generally, open source refers to a computer program whose source code is available to the public for use or modification from its initial design. Code is released under the terms of a software license. Depending on the license terms, people can download, modify, and publish their version (fork) back to the community.Open source software is usually a free software product, where people have access to the source code. They can enhance the programâ€™s performance, add some features, and fix errors. Some examples of such software are LibreOffice, Firefox, and VLC Media Player.

### Everything has it's own pros and cons. Here are some of the pros and cons of Open Source :

### Pros :

* Collaboration between different peoples can bring new ideas that can be implemented on it leading to better software.

* It is secure to use because anyone can look what's going behind the scenes unlike proprietary softwares.

* Since the code can be modified by anyone, anyone can customize it to their own liking.

* Usually free to use.

* You actually can own your software instead of renting it.


### Cons :

* Commercialization is difficult to achieve.

* Fragmentation of software if a person doesn't like what the original community is doing. ( This can also be an advantage of Open Source, depending upon people's perspective. )

* There is always the possibility that the developers of a program lose interest in working further on the software or just move on to another project.

* Unlike proprietary softwares where you can phone or email them for instant tech support open source doesn't have a proper tech support medium.
