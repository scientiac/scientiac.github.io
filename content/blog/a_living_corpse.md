What is to live? If not a wait for death.  
I worry at times. What if now's the end?  
To not have a purpose is a scary feeling.  
What is to die? If not to stop believing.  

Excited for the future, but not too far.  
Believing why you are, the way you are.  
Scared to accept, that beyond doesn't exist.  
Living ideal stories, while verities missed.  

Tallying truth with good, and false with bad.  
Questioning each step, yet following same path.  
Why are we bound to the norms man has made.  
While there are infinite paths, one can take.  

If acceptance more valued, and ambitions low,  
desires become a curse for who wants to grow.  
Living matters more, than what's after you die.  
It doesn't even matter, if you die living a lie.
