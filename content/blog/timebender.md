Trapped in the layers of time,  
are the stories I might not know,  
blips and flashes of faint sparks,  
around it, as the rock piles grow.  
Times I wish to wind back time,  
live those flashbacks a few times,  
what I'll get will be what I want,  
knowing there's only one way front.  
We are there, for a blink of eye,  
our time bubble pops, and it dries,  
fake scenarios I build, interrupts,  
and layers, they get more corrupt.  
Those layers grow as I walk with you,  
stories born each step we move,  
even far, you slow down my time,  
your presence fuels the time unwind.  
Then, there are times I walk with you,  
a mile feels like, footsteps few,  
but the path though same way back,  
always the longest I've ever walked.
