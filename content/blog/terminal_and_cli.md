## It's like alcohol, bitter in the beginning, obsessive later.

A terminal in reality is a hardware component that is used to enter and transcribe data to the computer but the terminal we are talking about is an emulator of the hardware; a terminal emulator.
  
We linux users without the use of terminal suffer to do basic stuff. Searching for a command from a huge list of buttons is a hassle, if you know what the command is you can immediately execute the particular command in a split second. Since, the GUI is built around the terminal interface rather than making a GUI application and then implimenting the termnal functionality, it is much easier as well as faster to execute simple commmands in the terminal to get the work done. 

### Advantages of using a CLI

* CLI applications takes less space than a full fledged GUI application.
* Being lighter it is snappy to work on.
* It is clean and minimal.
* Great applications like awk, grep, wget etc. are available which are designed to do one thing and do it well.
* Because it is so flexible. Commands can be piped together (ls | grep filename), they can be captured (gcc program.c > ./standard_out 2> ./standard_error), and can be substituted (ls /home/`whoami` or ls /home/$(whoami))
* Detailed information about what a program is doing can be seen in TUI interface which is generally disabled in GUI for the sake of making the it look beautiful.
* Because of the ability to automate tasks. cron and bash scripts allow long, complicated, and/or repetitive tasks to either be simplified or automated completely.
* It is universal and is same across all kinds of *nix operating system despite of the use of different DEs , Themes or Layouts. 
* You get to know and handle the tools better.

### Disadvantages of using a CLI

* Remembering all the differrent commands is hectic.
* Multimedia applications are useless.
* A lot of inappropriate command some would say.
* Bad for certain tasks that involves graphical UI.
* Things that require a lot of typing, such as long file names, can be annoying without minimal cut/paste support.

People when they feel the need of using a CLI get scared of the *nix operating systems (Windows do have a command line interface but not as powerful as the *nix terminal.), this is a reason why people are afraid to try linux and is it's greatest dis-advantage.
