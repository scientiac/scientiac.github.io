With the big bang   
Dust was formed.  
Those combined  
Stars were born.  
Some big some small,  
rocks were found.  
They revolved around  
and then turned round.  
  
With passage of time   
galaxies were formed.  
One of the galaxies,  
is our home,  
which contains a star  
that we call sun.  
  
It was burning  
It was big.  
A ball of fire  
revolved around it.  
As the ball   
started to cool  
Something called water  
began to drool.  
  
On the water  
life was formed.  
As life grew up,  
it used the sun.  
Seeing the sun  
up came plants.  
They were everywhere  
on water , on land.  
  
With plants on land  
fishes came up  
Breathing under water  
living on sand.  
Then they left water,  
land was home.  
On the forests   
they began to roam.  
  
They grew up  
with the trees.  
Also started flying  
like birds and bees.  
Like the trees   
they were huge.  
With their presence  
earth would lose.  
  
And then one day.  
the sky was bright.  
Big ones slept  
the remaining were light.  
Small creatures   
began to hide  
under the ground  
without any light.  
  
The earth was cold  
everything was freezing.  
It was ice age   
when they were living.  
As the ice  
began to melt,  
All the creatures  
relieved they felt.  
  
The trees were back  
the sun was warm.  
The birds started flying  
and bees with swarm.  
The apes came up  
and, then came men.  
Men built houses  
Men made farms  
That was how,  
we evolved.  
  
All with time  
we filled the earth.  
With cities and kingdoms  
Fights were fought.  
After all settled  
we all were one,  
We made tech.  
we made phones.  
Suddenly the earth  
was small as stones.  
  
On that earth  
They both were found.  
Then they married  
the oath was sworn.  
They were together,  
love was grown.  
And that is how   
You were born.
