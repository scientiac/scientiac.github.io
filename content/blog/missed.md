What have I done for you?  
Do I expect some things?  
I've always been there, your shadow.  
Pushing limits, the poem sings.  
  
Why do I feel not included?  
Do you see me as a stranger?  
I've been there with you all the time.  
Yet I'm alone, it's all stranger danger.   
  
Seeing you, I think it's love.  
Things I'd do to make you smile.  
And yet you've lost me here.   
I see you found your style.  
  
Expectations, they are gone now.  
I think, I am done here.  
Ignoring you would be so great.  
You don't know what love is, dear.  
  
I've lost people this way.  
One person at a time.  
Now I feel how my mom felt.  
I've been too kind, I'm fine.  
  
Blind spots, though, you see things.  
I was always in your side.  
Some sides you don't notice.  
Though, you notice far and wide.  
  
I don't care what you saw.  
I always did my part there.  
You should have seen me do it.  
My spectra were loud and clear.  
  
Now I think why I did it.  
Should not have pushed the bounds.  
Now, every time it scares me.  
Your eyes, the face, those sounds.   
  
Think I'll stop what I did.   
But others deserve the same.   
So, I'll behave the same way.   
Until I finish crossing their name.  
  
I don't feel missed by you.   
Because feelings can be false.   
But the proof doesn't lie me.   
You missed me, middle of the alls.
