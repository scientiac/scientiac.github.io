Flowing in the waves of pop,  
Burning in the flames of rock,  
Soaked in the smoothness of jazz,  
Gliding through the electric tunes,  
Flying over the clouds of chords,  
Floating over the booming beats,  
Haven't stopped dancing, I'm moving,  
My blood warms up, I'm shaking,  
Tiptoeing, it feels so light,  
Fuzzy feeling, it's elegantly basic,  
My heart beats slow, eyes glowing,  
Calms me down, the world feels bright,  
These rhythms make me feel things,  
Like a fairy, I'm swinging my wings,  
Dancing in the clouds, it's a vibe,  
Eating, breathing, thinking music,  
Songs can bring me dead to life.
