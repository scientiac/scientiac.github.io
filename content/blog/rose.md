<div style="text-align: left">

Dear Rose,  

You don't have a choice to make.  
With me, your thorns don't need to break.  
You'll have nothing at stake.  
You are red, the smell of blood, no need to fake.  
Now's the time to wake, don't wait.  
It's the only chance you'll get.  
Only a miracle that you and I met.  
With me you'll forget, all the things in your head,  
that keeps you awake, crying on your bed.  
You can make the same mistakes, this time.  
There will be no regrets, when you're mine.  
Poke holes in my heart, it still is fine.  
Be my queen of darkness, no need to shine.  
My partner in crime, red blood in my wine.  
Be on my mind, all the time, each word I write,  
all the words I rhyme, I will stop the time,  
wipe all mankind, just give me your word,  
that you will always be mine.  
And, forever will be mine.

</div>
