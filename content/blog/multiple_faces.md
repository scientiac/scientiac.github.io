_This one is for you. How many faces do you have?_

_How many? I think I lost count._

_I hate her with all my guts._

_I don't understand, if you hate her so badly, why do you still talk to her 
nicely. Why not confront her? After all, she may not realize that something 
she is doing is making you feel bad._

_Did I ask you for a solution? Just listen to me. Also, I am a good person, I
can't confront her like that. I will let someone else do that for me. What I
currently know is I hate her._

_Maybe it's the work of this good person to let them know that it is making 
you uncomfortable. After all, this is a talk you should be having with that
friend not me._

_Well, I don't know, I can't do that. It's not me. Do you not have people you 
hate? At least, people you don't like?_

_No, I mean I may have some people that I didn't like at that moment of time 
but I forget easily, so next time I meet them I just behave and talk with them
how I previously did. With my face I specially created for them when I got to 
know them._

_So, you don't have people you hate? Not even a single person? I mean, there is
at least a person that someone doesn't like in their life by one way or another._

_Maybe I will have one, one day. But I don't think I currently have one. We, were
talking about multiple faces. Why do you think you need multiple faces for 
multiple people._

_Well, there are people I like and I want them to keep liking me. And there are 
people I don't like, and I don't care what they think of me, so, I become a 
little devilish to them. And there are teachers, friends, relatives various 
people with various ways they see me. Having one for each is to maintain 
balance. Why did you ask me that? You yourself said you lost track of your faces
why do you think you need multiple faces?_

_I don't think I "need" them, it's just to hide who I am to people I don't know.
I tend to gradually turn into the me-me when I get to know them better, to let
them know me better._

_But all my faces are me. It's all me. I just want different people to remember 
me differently, according to how they treat me._

_But what if your friends who know you differently meet? Won't they have totally
different take on you. What if one hates you for the same reason someone likes 
you?_

_Why do you keep calling them both my "friends", obviously the one I like is my
friend and the other isn't. Do you call everyone who talk with you your friend?_

_Hmm, I thought that was a friend. Someone who you talk to and someone who talks
to you, no matter how they behave, if they are with you, they are your friends,
at least, I think it that way. I think I am missing a point here._

_How I see it, that friends are those special people who match your personality
who thinks the same things you do. Who supports you with the things you do.
You are together for everything. I have people who talk to you, whom I don't 
consider my friends. You should see my inbox, there are so many weird people in 
the earth._

_Maybe you are a beautiful lady, I only have people who I talk to, and I don't 
get many messages from random people. Even if I do, it's about something, or 
they go straight to my spam list. Also, I didn't mean your internet friends I 
meant your real life ones. Internet friends are a whole other topic, haha._

_Oh, I don't know. I had a friend, but she lives far from me, we rarely meet, we
sometimes chat, I always wish to meet her. I will anytime I get a chance. It's
so sad that we had to go separate places after college. I don't feel like any 
of my colleague are my friends, they only come they need me, want something
from me._

_What? Your colleagues are not your friends? I think we have completely different
Views for who we consider a friend. How do you live a life without having 
any friends around? I couldn't._

_I mean, see, the one I was talking about, she is infuriating. And others are 
boys who think they can "get" me by smooth talking, augh! Disgusting. And there
are people who admire you in front of you, but they do that to everyone. I don't
think they are worthy to be called friends._

_Well, if you put it that way... I guess. But, maybe they need a chance to get 
to know you better if you want them to treat you in a special way than others.
Like, I wouldn't have shared my story with you if we never talked more than 
buisness affairs. So, you don't consider me a friend, do you?_

_Well, are you on my side? I don't know._

_Haha, am I on your side? You betcha I am. But I am also on everyone else's sidebecause I know them all, and they seem like good people. Look, that guy too, he 
once hit me with a plastic bottle. We had a fight. I took the last drop from the
water filter when he was waiting behind me to fill his bottle. I don't think it
was a good thing to hit me like that, but that doesn't determine that he always 
wants to fight._

_You are weird, you still talk to him? Even if he hit you for something that was
not in your control? What kind of person is he? I don't like him now._

_Maybe, it was in my control, maybe it wasn't. I just don't think that one thing
made him the worst person for life. I got to know him after. He was scared that
I had come to take a revenge. He is a chill guy indeed, something may have 
got on his nerve that day._

_If you say so. Look, she is coming toward us. Ahh, now what does she want from
me again?_

_Heyyyyyy! I have to buy a some things for my sister's birthday, will you go 
shopping with me?_

_Why not, sure. You wait, I have to get my keys._

_Oh, I thought we were going together. I'll drive, we have to come back here
anyway._

_Sure! Right now?_

_Yeah! lets go hurry!_

_I'll show you where I shop, you'll like it._

_Hey, I'm back. I saw this cute dress and had to buy it. She wanted someone to
go with her, I wouldn't have found this dress if that hadn't happened._

_See, I was right. She isn't bad all the time, is she?_

_She is still the same her at the office, though._

.  
.  
.  

_Hey, you're here, I was searching for you. Let's go, I'll take you to my 
favourite restaurant today. I have to repay you for showing me that place, haha._

_Sure, where?_

_You'll know. By the way, who is that guy you were talking to?_

_We just... he... I... Ignore him. He talks way too much._
