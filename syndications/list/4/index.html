Also, being a tinkerer, I spent most of my time tinkering with my Linux system and android custom ROMs.<p>Today I felt like I was missing out a lot and kinda wanted to game. Gave it a quick search and found "Hollow Knight" which seems like my type of game so I purchased it on steam. Might as well call it my first desktop game. It feels special.</div></article><article class=syndicate><h2><a href=https://scientiac.space/syndications/posse-2023-10-20/>You and What's on Your Mind</a></h2><p class="subtitle --center"><code class="dateandtag dt-published">2023-10-21</code> <code class="u-category dateandtag">POSSE</code><p><div class=syndicate-text><p>I think it's normal to assume whats going one someone's mind (prejudge) and make decisions based on it. Like, If I assume something about you and do something based on that assumption and you feel like I understand you, It's a different feeling, a happy feeling. But, it's a gamble, because what if the assumption is incorrect, what if how I acted ruined the interaction?<p>So, I believe knowing a person requires a longer time then we want it to take and it will consist of mistakes and lucks that'll slowly form a decent representation of a person in our mind. For a tech nerd like me the best example for the process of getting to know a person is like training an AI model. Like, look at how DALL.E could generate images a few years back and how it generates images in the current state.<p>So, yeah! We don't know a person within a month or even an year or a lifetime because knowing is only predicting what the other mind would think and it's constantly changing and evolving. And when we think we know a person it's only a close enough representation of the actual person in our head compared to what they really are, similar to DALL.E making images out of probability and assumptions.</div></article><article class=syndicate><h2><a href=https://scientiac.space/syndications/posse-2023-10-04/>Holidays and Plans</a></h2><p class="subtitle --center"><code class="dateandtag dt-published">2023-10-04</code> <code class="u-category dateandtag">POSSE</code><p><div class=syndicate-text><p>3rd Semester of Computer Engineering is over now, and the vacation starts. This time, like all the semester endings, I have a lot of ideas and plans in mind and I hope to complete at least some of them if not all. Last vacation I looked into the Rust book and this holidays I want to try making a project in rust.<p>The other thing is that I switched from Fedora to NixOS, the Nix language and the OS's declerativeness has gotten me interested in Haskell and functional paradigm in general. Also, lambda calculus, currying, monads and other concepts originated from functional paradigm are very interesting.<p>I hope to learn something flashy✨, something technical⚙ and something unique❄️ this holiday.</div></article><article class=syndicate><h2><a href=https://scientiac.space/syndications/posse-2023-08-14/>GitHub Field Day</a></h2><p class="subtitle --center"><code class="dateandtag dt-published">2023-08-14</code> <code class="u-category dateandtag">POSSE</code><p><div class=syndicate-text><p>I like the initiative by GitHub to bring like-minded people of tech in a single place by organising un-conferences around the globe. On one hand, I am excited to meet people like me but on the other hand, it's GitHub(Microsoft) whose product I will become as the saying goes "If you aren't paying for the product, you are the product".<p>Anyways, meeting my people is more important and about being a product, that should be handled strategically. I'll try to include other git hosting platforms like gitlab, codeberg and forgejo whenever I say the word GitHub, think that's more healthy.</div></article><article class=syndicate><h2><a href=https://scientiac.space/syndications/posse-2023-07-27/>research::map</a></h2><p class="subtitle --center"><code class="dateandtag dt-published">2023-07-24</code> <code class="u-category dateandtag">POSSE</code><p><div class=syndicate-text><p>I created a new section called <a href=https://map.scientiac.space>map.scientiac.space</a> to keep track of researches and notes I create throughout my journey in the tech world.

One's beliefs can be drastically different from the other and yet none would listen to the other and look at it from their perspective as well. Humans have evolved learning things and passing the technique that helped them survive to the new generation, so it isn't a big deal to assume that they survived fine with those beliefs, and it is far optimal to pass on that belief than to gamble with new opinions.<p>Anyway, I hope it doesn't just remain as a new term in my vocabulary. I believe that one should be able to change their mind on things, change my mind!</div></article><article class=syndicate><h2><a href=https://scientiac.space/syndications/posse-2023-05-03/>Officially a Space Explorer</a></h2><p class="subtitle --center"><code class="dateandtag dt-published">2023-05-03</code> <code class="u-category dateandtag">POSSE</code><p><div class=syndicate-text><center> <p><strong>Domain</strong><br> <code>dō-mān′</code></p> </center><ol><li>A territory over which rule or control is exercised.<li>A sphere of activity, influence, or knowledge: synonym: field.<li>The set of all possible values of an independent variable of a function.<li>An open connected set that contains at least one point.</ol><p>Yep!

Anyways, the consistency with GTK apps was what I liked about it and the essence of that still remains in hyprland with EWW which is configured in yuck, hence the title.<p>EWW works as almost all the things, but some standalone apps are still better to have, so I have used swaync as the notification daemon and rofi-wayland as the launcher. Overall the system is pretty usable now, and I just love hyprland's animations.</div></article><article class=syndicate><h2><a href=https://scientiac.space/syndications/posse-2023-04-30/>Chapter Two: Sophomore</a></h2><p class="subtitle --center"><code class="dateandtag dt-published">2023-04-30</code> <code class="u-category dateandtag">POSSE</code><p><div class=syndicate-text><p>Yes!

Yeah! Yeah! This is one of those hot takes on "Love" ooOooh!!<p>Human nature is weird. Like, how someone would behave when they feel like they're loved and how the behavior would change when they feel like they are indifferent to them. It's quite fascinating that the behavioral and psychological pattern change, how cute turns into offensive and feelings turn into conscious infatuation. Apparently hope plays quite a big role in it. One could argue that "love" is nothing but just hopefulness. And when one gets hopeless, everybody knows how that goes.<p>This is neither a paper nor a thesis, it's just my take on love today. So, I suppose it's better incomplete and a hot take than a "WHAT I SAY IS ALWAYS TRUE" of a vibe.
