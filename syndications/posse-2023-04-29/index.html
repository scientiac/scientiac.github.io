Yeah! Yeah! This is one of those hot takes on "Love" ooOooh!!
Human nature is weird. Like, how someone would behave when they feel like they&#39re loved and how the behavior would change when they feel like they are indifferent to them. It&#39s quite fascinating that the behavioral and psychological pattern change, how cute turns into offensive and feelings turn into conscious infatuation. Apparently hope plays quite a big role in it. One could argue that "love" is nothing but just hopefulness. And when one gets hopeless, everybody knows how that goes.
This is neither a paper nor a thesis, it&#39s just my take on love today. So, I suppose it&#39s better incomplete and a hot take than a "WHAT I SAY IS ALWAYS TRUE" of a vibe. Bye!
