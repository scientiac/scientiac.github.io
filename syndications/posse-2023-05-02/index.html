Anyways, the consistency with GTK apps was what I liked about it and the essence of that still remains in hyprland with EWW which is configured in yuck, hence the title.
EWW works as almost all the things, but some standalone apps are still better to have, so I have used swaync as the notification daemon and rofi-wayland as the launcher. Overall the system is pretty usable now, and I just love hyprland's animations.
